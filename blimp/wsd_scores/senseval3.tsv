1	argument	4	Her National Gallery choices of pictures were examples of problems posed to artists by colour ,  and in a video talk she demonstrated how these artistic problems had been solved .  Connections with her own practice as a painter were evident ,  even though her abstract compositions were very different in subject from the works of her chosen artists ,  who included Veronese and Poussin .  Her	argument	was that the subjects of the old master paintings could be disregarded by a painter who wished to find lessons for the present in the artistic practice of the past . Bridget Riley had no intention of either presenting an account of Poussin 's  aims and procedures ,  or of demonstrating Veronese 's  debts to his predecessors in Venetian art ,  as a historian would have felt a duty to do .  The artist as critic in this case deliberately avoided the historical context  of the pictures she was discussing .	None
2	argument	2	If a critic has a very decided political or religious point of view ,  this can override other considerations in judgements about art ;  the viewpoint may also give a bias to the description or interpretation made .  A remarkable Marxist interpretation ,  for example ,  was made of Florentine painting from Giotto 's  time to the fifteenth century ,  by Frederick Antal in the 1940s .  Later writers , even those sympathetic to Antal 's thesis , have admitted that the	argument	about class conflict in the period was exaggerated , but this does not exclude the possibility that an equally unexpected approach may not throw light on some apparently exhausted topic . Of course ,  a theorist may damage an argument through bias ,  perhaps excluding relevant evidence inconvenient to the case being made ;  but this is not a danger exclusive to theorists .  Omissions are most patent perhaps in surveys made with a political bias .	None
3	argument	4	A remarkable Marxist interpretation ,  for example ,  was made of Florentine painting from Giotto 's  time to the fifteenth century ,  by Frederick Antal in the 1940s .  Later writers ,  even those sympathetic to Antal 's  thesis ,  have admitted that the argument about class conflict in the period was exaggerated ,  but this does not exclude the possibility that an equally unexpected approach may not throw light on some apparently exhausted topic .  Of course , a theorist may damage an	argument	through bias , perhaps excluding relevant evidence inconvenient to the case being made ; but this is not a danger exclusive to theorists . Omissions are most patent perhaps in surveys made with a political bias .  We have already mentioned in passing the state policies regarding the arts in Germany ,  the USSR and  China ;  there have been writers who followed the party lines by giving attention to those artists favoured by patronage ,  while neglecting others .	None
4	argument	2	As in books on the philosophy of art ,  or aesthetics ,  many do not in fact contain any art criticism ,  in the sense of description ,  interpretation and judgement of individual works .  Their strengths are rather in clearing the ground of preconceived ideas about the arts ,  and putting new points of view .  When works of art are described only those aspects of an image important to the	argument	are included . It is in this arena that some of the fiercest intellectual fighting about art is taking place ,  though the contests range wider than the visual arts to politics and economics .  For example ,  Chadwick states :  There can be no simple category defined as feminist art history ,  since the effect of new ideas is that much recent scholarly writing has shifted attention from the categories art and artist to broader issues concerning ideologies of gender ,  sexuality ,  and power .	None
5	argument	3	They may ,  however ,  not be exactly what the author would have preferred ,  as a colour plate which is readily available  ( perhaps having been used in another publication )  is much cheaper to use than a new plate which has to be commissioned .  The reader can thus be aware that a writer may have written round what happens to have been offered .  This may be important in assessing how well a writer illustrates an	argument	. The standards which can be obtained in colour reproductions today are high ,  but not always attained .  Comparison of illustrations of the same picture in several publications will demonstrate this truism ,  while the best test of looking at a reproduction in front of the picture itself can be a disheartening experience .	None
6	argument	2	In all capitalist democracies there are two sources for the legitimacy of the state ,  namely statehood itself and the ideology specific to the state in question .  It will be argued that when the second source is threatened as well as the first ,  the power to coerce can devolve on the civil sphere in a substantive way .  The conclusion to the	argument	will be that there is a specific form of violence of a political kind outside of state control which cannot be reduced to crime . The specificity of this form of violence or coercion has to be recognized ,  however one feels about the terrible consequences of it for the innocent .  This form of political violence requires political answers and not just an anti - criminal ,  police - oriented ,  coercive response .	None
7	argument	4	Covenant theology itself empowers the people to take action against the state in certain and specific circumstances ,  and Ian Paisley and many of his supporters both within and without the Orange order have frequently used bully - boy tactics ,  and approved paramilitary processions ,  marching ,  and drilling .  From Carson to Paisley one finds the argument that it is legitimate to fight to regain one 's  fundamental freedom if the sovereign with whom one has  covenanted one 's  allegiance betrays that allegiance and conducts one into slavery .  The	argument	is clearly inspired by a religious motivation and shows Ulster protestantism to be a vigorous form of political religion , approving whatever defensive measures are necessary to avoid submission to Rome rule. Ulster protestantism is not contained within churches but spills out on to the streets .  Religion is also involved in the violence indirectly .	None
8	argument	4	Perhaps the most revealing aspect of the whole affair is the way Dr Browne handled it .  The members of his party appeared to know nothing about the opposition of the hierarchy to the earlier Bill ,  and Dr Browne only found out in October/November 1950 .  When he was told of the hierarchy 's opposition to any bill of this kind , Dr Browne , himself secularly inclined , submitted his proposals and	arguments	to the hierarchy for approval , just as a previous Health Minister , Dr Walsh , had consulted Archbishop McQuaid on a similar matter in 1946 . If a man of such convictions felt it necessary to follow this course ,  how much more would have his religiously  devoted colleagues .  In fact ,  his cabinet colleagues ,  already unsure about public support for the bill and alienated from Dr Browne by his provocative politics ,  were not prepared to go against the hierarchy 's  condemnation and refused to support the proposal .	None
9	argument	4	But they did and still do remain the authoritative conscience of the nation .  In addition ,  the clergy appear to have considerable difficulty in recognizing the transformation which theoretical positions on Christian belief and morality undergo as they are concretized in historical human relationships ,  doubtless also because of the strong essentialist bias in their perception of socio - ethical issues .  Part of the overall	argument	of this book is that , as the Roman catholic church is principal validator or legitimator of the Southern state along with the concept of the national entity , what that state goes on to do in the field of social ethics cannot be separated out from the responsibilities of the church . This structural link between politics and religion is underlined by the legitimacy the church gives to the state as a whole ,  by recognizing it simply as society .  However ,  it is the further legitimation given to a particular socio - ethical form of political religion in the constitution and to the implied authority of religious intellectuals in deciding in concreto  what must be taken by the state as in the interests of the common good which gives to conflict in Ireland between the two alliances its political religious dimension in the sphere of law.	None
10	argument	2	These last were soon replaced ,  on 9 May ,  by a more specific and highly organized pressure group headed by many who had previously mounted the Pro - Life Anti - abortion Campaign .  Of particular importance to the anti - divorce campaign was a lawyer ,  William Binchy ,  who had already produced a book in 1984 on the subject .  Large publicity campaigns began and the Irish Times also lent its weight to the pro - divorce	argument	, campaigning in its columns until the eve of the referendum in late June. Though the coalition government were allowing their TDs  the Irish equivalent for MPs  a free vote on the issue ,  its parties ,  Fine Gael and Labour ,  officially sponsored the campaign for the constitutional change .  Fianna Fil appeared to be equally divided on the issue .	None
11	argument	4	This was the line already adopted by Binchy  ( 1984 )  who interpreted world - wide statistics in this direction .  Divorce was seen to be harder on the women than the men ,  who could get out of their family  responsibilities so much more easily with divorce than without it .  In opposing the	arguments	marshalled by the anti - divorce groups , the pro - divorce group argued that , despite the existence of divorce legislation in Northern Ireland , there was still a low divorce rate . The period of separation in undefended cases was two years ,  and five years had to run if one of the parties opposed the divorce .  That men in particular do not benefit from the procedures was suggested by the fact that twice as many women as men filed for divorce .	None
12	argument	4	One might be forgiven for thinking that the bishops letter had something to do with it and that Haughey was intent on constructing an alliance between those heeding the teaching of the hierarchy and the party faithful .  In early May ,  two - thirds of Fianna Fil TDs from the West had already indicated they would campaign in their constituencies against the amendment  (  Irish Times  ,  2 May 1986 )  .  The Woods ' speech also introduced an important new	argument	which may have had some considerable effect on Irish voters . It suggested that second marriages would substantially infringe the rights of inheritance of the members of the first family .  In a society of extremely strong rural ,  traditional values on rights of inheritance ,  the suggestions that constitutional Frankensteins would devour constitutional orphans  (  Dil Debates  ,  14 May 1986 )  were clearly calculated to raise a moral panic ,  having produced the appropriate folk - devils .	None
13	argument	4	The main grounds appeared to be  the danger which it might pose to the small Southern protestant minority by encouraging mixed marriages .  However ,  no evidence favouring such a contention has ever been produced .  Harry MacAdoo , then the Church of Ireland archbishop of Dublin , on several occasions put forward the	argument	that Southern protestants were a minority group with their own culture and traditions , and thus deserved to have schools for themselves in order to hand on their own traditions . When considering the merit of this argument ,  one does have to bear in mind the particularly precarious nature of the Southern protestant grouping .  Protestant opposition to integrated schooling is sometimes heard in the North ,  particularly from the fundamentalist camp ,  who not only fear catholic infiltration of state schools but are opposed to anything other than Bible protestantism in religious education .	None
14	argument	3	However ,  no evidence favouring such a contention has ever been produced .  Harry MacAdoo ,  then the Church of Ireland archbishop of Dublin ,  on several occasions put forward the argument that Southern protestants were a minority group with their own culture and traditions ,  and thus deserved to have schools for themselves in order to hand on their own traditions .  When considering the merit of this	argument	, one does have to bear in mind the particularly precarious nature of the Southern protestant grouping . Protestant opposition to integrated schooling is sometimes heard in the North ,  particularly from the fundamentalist camp ,  who not only fear catholic infiltration of state schools but are opposed to anything other than Bible protestantism in religious education .  But usually the opposite is the case and popular protestant support for integration is expressed .	None
15	argument	4	In the debates over the last twenty years there has been considerable interplay of theological and sociological reasoning ,  with social scientists also contributing to papers and discussions .  What has been seen as an aspect of the Roman catholic intellectual opposition to divorce in Chapter 5 can also be recognized as a feature of the defence of catholic schools too :  the opposition contains an interpretation of the moral nature of contemporary society and of what happens to catholics who are not to some degree protected from it .  In this writer 's view , the	arguments	against multi - denominational education and in favour of catholic schools support an overall political theology which is strongly based on authority within the church . Hierarchy and clergy are seen almost to monopolize the teaching and wisdom about life .  They are both directors of souls and minders of the public conscience .	None
16	argument	4	Put together with a faith vision of the contemporary social world as inherently secularist and radically subversive of Roman catholic values ,  the combination is significantly reactionary and ethnocentric .  The aspects of this political theology will be discussed later .  First it is necessary to consider the	arguments	used in the public debates . While the arguments of the defenders of catholic schools have a theological basis ,  those of the promoters of integrated schooling have been founded on what they see to be the results of the present system ,  namely a violent and destructive society .  But there has been some attempt also to undercut the basic level of the defenders '  case .	None
17	argument	4	Irish bishops have been well aware of Spencer 's   ( 1968 )  research .  Using traditional measures of religiosity ,  he has pointed out the apparent failure of English catholic schools to produce better catholics and fewer ex - catholics than state or  other schools ,  and has inferred the likelihood of the same for Irish schools .  Spencer 's	argument	has been banded about from time to time . This is not unnatural ,  as in the 1970s and early 1980s Spencer was at the Queen 's  University ,  Belfast ,  and an active member of the All Children Together Movement .  Support for this line of approach has been found in Greeley and Rossi 's   ( 1966 )  survey in the USA on the effectiveness of catholic schools .	None
18	argument	4	In the light of W. McCready 's  findings in another study that the religious behaviour of the father had a greater impact on children ,  Greeley considered the fact that catholic schools were having an increasing influence on men to be of significant importance for the future of Roman catholicism in the USA  ( 1976 :  1735 )  .  Clearly ,  the follow - up study was more favourable to the defenders of catholic schools than to opponents .  However , Greeley and Rossi 's work also has been used to uphold the defenders '	argument	that , though Roman catholic schools varied in their efficiency , they were certainly better than any possible alternative in terms of producing good Roman catholics . Thus ,  both sides have tended to use social scientific research to make statements in general about catholic schools which have been drawn from other countries and ,  therefore ,  beyond the cultural confines within which Irish catholic schools exist .  This is something  for which surveys ,  including that of Greeley and Rossi ,  are not and cannot be intended .	None
19	argument	5	There was nothing in the studies on the differences between individual catholic schools ,  either in terms of pupil experiences or the varieties of educational practice and personnel in each school .  A black - box approach to the schooling process was used with no direct investigation of processes within the schools .  Finally , while it could be argued that Greeley and Rossi tell us something of catholic versus state schooling in the US , they have nothing to tell us about catholic versus Christian , multi - denominational schools , which is what most of the	argument	in Ireland is about . But the central and substantive argument that defenders of Roman catholic schools have had to deal with is that the dual school system in Northern Ireland encourages ,  supports ,  or at least reinforces the sectarian divide ,  and that it forms part of the vicious circle maintaining conflict in Ulster .  It has been argued that one could help to break that circle by integrating the school system  ( Fraser 1974 ;  Heskin 1980 )  .	None
20	argument	4	A black - box approach to the schooling process was used with no direct investigation of processes within the schools .  Finally ,  while it could be argued that Greeley and Rossi tell us something of catholic versus state schooling in the US ,  they have nothing to tell us about catholic versus Christian ,  multi - denominational schools ,  which is what most of the argument in Ireland is about .  But the central and substantive	argument	that defenders of Roman catholic schools have had to deal with is that the dual school system in Northern Ireland encourages , supports , or at least reinforces the sectarian divide , and that it forms part of the vicious circle maintaining conflict in Ulster . It has been argued that one could help to break that circle by integrating the school system  ( Fraser 1974 ;  Heskin 1980 )  .  A small number of empirical studies actually done in Northern Ireland have been invoked in the course of the debate .	None
21	argument	4	Consequently ,  one has to improve relationships within Northern Ireland without trying to merge the entire school system .  However ,  curricular changes ,  joint teaching projects ,  and overall greater contact were seen necessary .  Roman catholic church leaders have used additional local studies to refute	arguments	which treat Roman catholic schools as part of the Northern problem . They have interpreted Salters 's  study of Belfast secondary schools as showing catholics to be less prejudiced than protestants .  Even if this were so ,  the implication has been made by catholic school supporters that catholic schools have not promoted or reinforced any measure of prejudice ,  and that no other possible type of school could improve on them  ( Daly 1975 )  .	None
22	argument	4	They have interpreted Salters 's  study of Belfast secondary schools as showing catholics to be less prejudiced than protestants .  Even if this were so ,  the implication has been made by catholic school supporters that catholic schools have not promoted or reinforced any measure of prejudice ,  and that no other possible type of school could improve on them  ( Daly 1975 )  .  Unfortunately , the necessary link to warrant this second conclusion a control group of catholics in a multi - denominational situation was simply not available to Salters , and so the	argument	is void . Use has also been made of Russell 's  work on the teaching of civics in Northern Ireland schools .  The work led Russell himself to conclude that the teaching of the subject had no effect whatsoever on pupils '  political outlook .	None
23	argument	2	Then all of a sudden ,  silence .  You keep waiting for more but it does n't come .  He works till lunch , then wanders into the kitchen and has long	argument	with Tony , or perhaps a discussion about the best way to cook trout or whether or not to sack the gardener . In the afternoon he starts by sleeping ,  then takes over the kitchen and insists on preparing extravagant five - course meals .  Had me take him into Salisbury to the oculist .	None
24	argument	5	I mean ,  I expect it 's  difficult to manage without harming them .  No  each lady had personally placed her cake on the long table  without assistance .  But then Mr Clancy and Mr Venables , who had been standing by to offer encouragement , had fallen into an	argument	concerning position . Mr Doran had moved his wife 's  cake to the first position ,  and Mr Clancy had moved it back to the middle ,  saying the first cake tasted had the best chance ,  and his wife 's  cake would be first as it had got there first .  Mr Venables disagreed and made some claim about tastebuds and their overstimulation .	None
25	argument	4	That Agatha Christie 's  reading was wide - ranging cannot now be denied ,  but ,  even so ,  the source of one of Hercule Poirot 's  favourite ploys  almost ,  it could be said ,  his trademark ,  the gathering together of the suspects at the climax of one of his investigations  is surprising .  It was only after extensive reading through the writings of many authors that I came across the work which undoubtedly gave the author this particular inspiration .  Here , from a late volume of The Scot Musical Museum , is the poem which clinches my	argument	. Though published anonymously ,  it is undoubtedly the work of Robert Burns :  CA ' THE BURGIES TAE THE BOGGIN CHORUS .	None
26	argument	4	I put Martha 's  apron on by accident this morning .  She 'd put a fifty - pound note in it and so she thought that it had been stolen .  When I found it , there was an	argument	and we went for each other. When did you discover your mistake   About the apron 	None
27	argument	5	However ,  if you are going to fly solo ,  refusing is the only sensible thing to do .  Flying demands all your concentration and it is not wise to risk flying if you have business worries or some other mental stress on your mind .  Even a violent	argument	will leave you mentally high and quite unfit to fly . You can also become unfit in the air through lack of food and drink .  Both these factors can cause lack of concentration and apathy .	None
28	argument	2	Traditionally in anthropology ,  the ethnographer has studied a social system or culture through a period of intensive participant observation in the field .  This has generated considerable concern about the ethnographic experience itself ,  and specifically about the subjective nature of the process .  Unlike the natural sciences , where discussion often starts with the results and ignores the methodology of the research , the social sciences and increasingly anthropology have developed an elaborate	argument	about the practices of doing research . The interpretation of culture and even the ability to understand what is happening in the society under scrutiny as well as the need to grapple with political or ethical questions are all endless and fundamental problems of the moment  ( Phillips 1973 :  78 )  .  Mere observation and reporting is inadequate ,  given the limited scope of things which can be truly observed  ( Holy 1984 :  25 )  .	None
29	argument	2	As social dirt they become an affront to purity and possess the danger of the contagious and impure  ( Douglas 1966 )  ,  requiring their removal from the public vision .  As yet there is no other body to undertake this task ,  and even tentative moves to remove the problem from the cell block and into the detoxification centre foundered in the entrepreneurial 1980s ;  for there is little immediate profit to be made from reclamation of this kind of scrap material  ( although the long - term value of a humanitarian return might be thought to be well worth pursuing in a civilized society !  )  .  The	argument	is therefore not about police control or a utopia without controls , but to explore why some cultural behaviour has a history of police action and to discover where that behaviour fits into police ideology . Its status or  ( as importantly )  its lack of value creates complex systems of meaning which are rarely articulated ;  for the police world has similar strictures to that which Benedict  ( 1967 )  described in her attempts to understand the rigidities of Japanese culture :  men who have accepted a system of values by which to live ,  cannot without courting in - efficiency and chaos keep for long a fenced - off portion of their lives where they think and behave according to a contrary set of values .	None
30	argument	4	to my senior command and in 1986 I informed my chief officers of the acceptance of my Ph.D .  thesis ,  in accordance with the directive laid down by Force Orders .  No one , of course , has asked to read it , for if my	argument	is correct the service has no need of any reminder of how the ideology works or how to implement the paradigms which support their cultural norms . Nor do they need their daily practice to be exposed to the analytic eye of anthropological thick description ,  for in their task - driven world there is little to be gained by reflecting on what they already live and understand .  Any need to analyse the ways in which the multi - variant police world forms a coherent and self - sustaining whole is material for the social scientist and not the practitioners ,  for they already live the system as a matter of course .	None
31	argument	4	A good proportion of our work concerned our availability to act as an unacknowledged arm of the social welfare service to drug users in crisis situations ,  providing a front - line service for the speed freaks who 's  OD 'd on the results of a bent script ,  or the acid heads having a bad trip ,  for we were in the streets ,  the pubs ,  the clubs ,  the crash pads ,  and communal houses frequented by the new alternative society .  Much of our daily work was ten years in advance of the official police community involvement programmes and yet our actions were only an extension of those social welfare activities the police have been heavily involved in for generations ,  but which are never given status as real police work simply because of the institutional emphasis placed upon summons lists ,  numbers of arrests ,  crime detections ,  and other statistical returns .  Many of our new counter - cultural deviants were articulate and presented very cogent	arguments	relating to their allegedly victimless crimes . For example ,  they would link their cannabis use and an alternative ideology or religious vision to challenge our somewhat static version of social reality .  Many of the underground at this period in social history were consciously making a journey towards a new spiritual growth ;  and this ,  as Furlong  ( 1973 :  106 )  suggests ,	None
32	argument	2	The Conversation Angus Cameron looked incredulous ,  permanently .  His friend James Menzies the wine merchant , in whose house he lodged , had said once , infuriated after a two - hour	argument	, Angus do you believe nothing completely  After thinking about it ,  Cameron replied ,  James ,  I was told a good thing once ,  by the sawyer at Bunarkaig .  I used to help there as a boy .	None
33	argument	4	Mrs Menzies had died five years before ,  killed by malaria and stomach trouble from their time in Bengal .  Menzies himself had a yellow face with a stained - looking flush on each cheekbone ,  and when he felt a bout of fever coming on ,  he drank to drown the symptoms .  Now he looked over at Cameron , taking stock of the quizzical lift of his right eyebrow when he looked out below his black fringe , the down - turn of his mouth under his long curved nose , and began to recapitulate his	argument	with care , uncomfortably aware that Angus might think he was trying not to sound drunk . Consider ,  Angus ,  he said .  They have seized the Session Books at Auchtergaven ,  and Kirkmichael ,  and Logierait ,  and  and many another place .	None
34	argument	4	He expected a few dozen people .  But the ranks and clusters of them stretched uncountably into the darkness .  He turned to James in amazement and saw that he was enjoying his surprise , as though it confirmed one of his	arguments	. Keen wafts of pine resin sharpened the air .  Torches were bubbling out flames and streaming smoke .	None
35	argument	2	He let his words trail off .  They all went over to the fire for plates of meat and bread .  In his mind Cameron continued the	argument	throughout the meal . He found in Byers a bracing scepticism like his own .  Yet speculation was actually fruitless now .	None
36	argument	4	With the weather holding .  There will be fewer to bring it in next year ,  when the listed men have gone .  Menzies brought out the familiar	argument	. They will settle for the devil they know .  Who does n't 	None
37	argument	2	Yes ,  urged .  By a show of force   By reasoned	arguments	concerning the hardship it would bring upon the district if some hundreds of the most able - bodied young men had to go . Mr Cameron ,  are you suggesting that your repeated speeches  and mind ,  we have abundant eye - witness testimony concerning them  contained no word about the driving out  of proprietors   Or of ministers and teachers 	None
38	argument	2	I had to adopt  the aspect of receptivity .  I was very receptive to the Bible ,  authority .  I was n't interested in	argument	, philosophy I took the simple biblical past Having no father I tried to capitalise  ( on his absence )  ,  resolve the Oedipal struggle ,   ( create )  good feelings .	None
39	argument	4	Since these states of affairs are of the essence of human perceptual consciousness and ,  therefore ,  of the human mind ,  it must follow that there are non - physical states of affairs essential to the human mind .  So a materialist theory of the mind is false .  The most primitive physicalist response to this	argument	is to deny the claim that there is anything about the mind that BS does not know . All that BS lacks is an ability to respond directly to stimuli of certain sorts :  V knows no more than BS ,  he can simply do something BS cannot .  BS is like a man who knows all about swimming ,  even to the point of being able to train the Olympic team ,  but who cannot swim himself ,  and V is the man with the normal talent for swimming .	None
40	argument	1	But this brings us back to the initial problem ,  which was precisely to explain how materialism could accommodate such a feel .  We cannot ,  therefore ,  leave it as an irreducible fact about different physical processes that they feel different .  In fact , the mode of access	argument	is ambiguous . It might be interpreted as saying that V has a mode of access to his own brain different from any modes of access to V 's  brain available to BS ;  or that V has a different mode of access to the external world ,  and that this constitutes the difference between him and BS .  It is impossible to deny that V has a different mode of access to the external world from BS ,  for V can see and BS cannot .	None
41	argument	4	It would make no sense to say that the dots in the picture had a Gestalt  of themselves ,  but to apply this model to the brain and experience would be just like that ;  for ,  if the experience just is  a state of the brain ,  then there is no way in which the character of the experience can be explained as the result of some perspective on  the brain .  Nor ,  more abstractedly ,  could it be the result of a perspective on the informational content of the brain ;  for ,  in either case ,  the perspective would have to be the occurrence of some further brain or informational state and to both of these the scientist has complete access ,  and the problem reoccurs .  If what I said above is correct , failure of the mode of access	argument	forces the materialist to deny that BS lacks any knowledge and to adopt a behaviourist theory . When a behaviourist approach is employed ,  it is not applied only to perception ,  but to all cognitive states .  Remembering that philosophers of the seventeenth and eighteenth century had already assimilated thought to perception ,  this is not surprising .	None
42	argument	0	First ,  an objector might try to press the fashionable distaste for the first - person perspective and say that the fact that I cannot apply the theory to myself shows nothing except that one should not approach the philosophy of mind via the first person .  A philosophical theory is essentially a reflection on a practice ,  and the first - person perspective expresses engagement in the practice :  to apply the theory first - personally is to confuse levels .  This is a spurious	argument	. A philosophical account gives the necessary and sufficient conditions  ( at least in outline form )  for the application of a concept ,  and it should ,  therefore ,  apply in principle to anything that is a case of that concept .  If it really is the case that all I am doing when I have beliefs about the world is to have dispositions to behave ,  then it ought to make sense for me to think of my believing in those terms .	None
43	argument	4	In showing that cognition as a whole cannot be treated behaviouristically ,  I have not thereby shown that a behaviouristic treatment of sense - experience is false .  So perhaps my overkill misses the target :  perhaps the behaviourist analysis of perception is sound ,  even though a general behaviourism is not ,  and what BS lacks is not knowledge of the nature of certain mental states ,  but only the ability to respond spontaneously to visual stimuli ,  that is ,  to respond as a result of actually seeing them .  Reflection on the nature of the	argument	refutes the behaviourist treatment of perception in particular . That argument showed that knowledge of the external world cannot be reduced to behavioural dispositions ,  for the very idea of a disposition functions only in the context of an unreduced grasp on the physical world .  But there is nowhere else that we might get our conception of the physical world from ,  other than perception .	None
44	argument	4	There are ,  though ,  a host of reasons for resisting any kind of equation between mental representations and mental pictures ;  and all of these derive from one fundamental reason .  Any mental picture will require interpretation ,  and this interpretation will be another mental operation ,  which ,  on the view that thinking is having mental pictures ,  will be another picture ,  which itself will require interpretation ,  and so on and so on .  This may look like an easy knock - down	argument	against a silly theory which nobody has ever seriously held : but what is true of mental pictures would seem to be true of any kind of mental representing process which encodes sensations in some determinate form . In other words ,  the argument works equally against the view that we think in a kind of mental language ,  that mental sentences rather than mental pictures are the stuff of thought .  Sentences and words also require interpretation  indeed they would seem to require this more obviously than pictures  and so we 're back on the circle of infinite regress .	None
45	argument	4	Well how do I know  that this computer does not have a theory of the external world   I have no argument ,  an objector would say ,  just a prejudice .  Well , I think that there is an	argument	of sorts for saying that a computer of the kind described does not have a theory of the external world , does not have mental states which refer , and does not therefore have thoughts in any significant sense . There is representation in a language but no knowledge ,  and therefore no thought in the human sense .  We should attend to the fact that knowledge of the external world means representing a lot of facts at once ,  so many facts that we lose hold of the idea of representation .	None
46	argument	1	But this is a fairly repugnant conclusion to most of us .  Do we really want to say that all we ever learn we knew before  even if we are  saying this in some technical computational sense   How about a more modest version of the	argument	which says that only certain primitive concepts are innate ( about three - dimensionality , causal relations , etcetera ) , and that the more sophisticated concepts develop out of these through the time - honoured processes of differentiating finer concepts from global ones and integrating the results into complex , structured concepts . This is not much help because  ( a )  later - developing concepts must still on the representational theory of the mind  be present in these primitive concepts  ( there are no merely potential competences  such as my potential but non - existing competence to know Portuguese )  ;  and  ( b )  how and where do we draw the line between the primitive concepts and the developed ones   Predictably ,  perhaps ,  I regard this argument not as a demonstration that the acquisition of new concepts is impossible ,  but as another reductio ad absurdum  of the representational theory of the mind .	None
47	argument	4	Constructivism and development The constructivist theory of mind regards thinking on an analogy with action ;  just as the representation theory takes an analogy with drawing and writing .  Moreover , to the same extent that the representational theory is non - developmental ( recall the Fodor 's	argument	against learning ) , the constructivist theory is developmental . I would not say that the developmental view is a consequence of the thoughtaction analogy exactly ,  because there could be constructivist theories that do not mention development .  It is certain ,  though ,  that the constructivism that has received the most attention in psychology and philosophy has been the developmental theory of Jean Piaget .	None
48	argument	4	So why not say ,  then ,  that in development perception teaches action ,  that as the information delivered up by the input systems becomes progressively richer the infant becomes better able to direct his own movements ,  rather than saying that cognisance develops out of action   My answer to this point will be more philosophical than empirical .  It will rely upon an	argument	from Kant . In the Critique of Pure Reason  ,  Kant 's  aim was to show how objective experience is possible ,  to set out the conditions necessary for this ;  whilst Piaget 's  aim was to show ,  given certain Kantian assumptions ,  how objective experience  actually develops .  One of the conditions for ascribing to oneself experiences of a mind - independent reality ,  Kant argued ,  was that we should be capable of distinguishing between those sequences of perceptions  ( if you like ,  representations delivered up by the input systems )  which are determined by the movement of objects and those which are determined by our own movements .	None
49	argument	1	Autism is a very profound cognitive deficit indeed ,  and everything that I have said up to now entails that a person whose thinking significantly lacks an holistic character ,  and lacks the related qualities of directedness ,  inhibition and co - ordination ,  will be profoundly affected .  Coda We have covered a lot of ground , and maybe the path through the undergrowth of	arguments	and data is not a very straight or a very clear one . I certainly would not want to attempt a summary of the route we have taken all the way from the mind - body problem to children trying to win chocolates ;  but I do need to make some concluding comments to justify the bold claim in the first paragraph that constructivism makes the mind - body problem less intractable .  I argued that the representational theory of mind ,  with its assumption that thinking is the possession of determinate mental states which are in some sense encodings  ( pictorial ,  syntactic )  of actual or possible states of affairs ,  contributes to the difficulty of the mind - body problem .	None
50	argument	2	I How might such states be both mental and physical at the same time   We do not want to say that one kind of state causes the other kind ,  but neither does it make much sense to say that they are parallel or identical .  There are	arguments	for all possible positions , but none of them convinces us for long ( see chapters 1 and 5 ) . Recall that constructivism refers only to mental representations at  the level of the input systems ,  as entities which can be translated ,  more or less directly ,  into the language of neuropsychology .  ( It refuses to take seriously the claim that central - system processes  -  thinking  are explicable in terms of the causal interplay of representations .  )	None
51	argument	4	Most ,  perhaps all ,  functionalists are thorough - going materialists who believe that mental phenomena are genuine physical  phenomena seen at a particular level of abstraction .  This commitment to materialism means that a couple of standard dualist objections must be faced .  First , there is the dualist 's	argument	that mental processes cannot be physical processes because physical entities such as neurons - lack certain qualities such as intentionality or consciousness that characterize the mental . The response to this is that intentionality and consciousness are emergent properties  of physical systems .  Neurons do not individually have the property of consciousness ,  consciousness emerges when a large number of neurons are interacting in the right kind of way ;  just as speed  is a property not of any single component of a car ,  but an emergent property of the whole system  when it is operating in an appropriate way .	None
52	argument	4	Furthermore ,  the work of Young and his colleagues ,  which I shall be discussing later in the chapter ,  shows that being aware of the operations of ,  say ,  one 's  face processing system has vitally important functional consequences .  However ,  the functionalist view is that it would be quite misguided to attempt to explain behaviour by making direct reference to the subjective  or phenomenal  qualities  ( technically known as qualia  )  of these mental states .  If it is really necessary to think of mental states as having qualitative content ( and see Dennett , 1988 , for some powerful	arguments	that it is not ) , then it follows from functionalism that such qualia do not have causal interactions with other mental states or behaviour and are mere epiphenomena . Successful Science The sceptic might ,  at this point ,  complain that while I may have sketched out the functionalist position ,  I have not provided any convincing arguments as to why one should believe it .	None
53	argument	4	If it is really necessary to think of mental states as having qualitative content  ( and see Dennett ,  1988 ,  for some powerful arguments that it is not )  ,  then it follows from functionalism that such qualia do not have causal interactions with other mental states or behaviour and are mere epiphenomena .  Successful Science The sceptic might , at this point , complain that while I may have sketched out the functionalist position , I have not provided any convincing	arguments	as to why one should believe it . What I now want to suggest is that there is a lot of very successful science currently being conducted which literally depends on functionalism being true .  If functionalism is false ,  then the success of the cognitive sciences is a massive scientific fluke .	None
54	argument	4	This is the myth that I want to examine here .  Although the majority of scientists tend to be a little coy about metaphysical matters in their professional publications ,  they are often less so outside when writing elsewhere ,  being prone to describe the framework of presuppositions about perception within which they conduct their investigations as if it were a discovery in its own right and that discovery an explanation of perception .  And although the majority of materialist philosophers base their belief in the neurophysiological theory of perception on	arguments	rather than observations , they are , nevertheless , greatly influenced by the apparent successes of neurophysiology . The Materialist Theory of Perception We may think of consciousness as having two components :  sensation and perception on the one hand and willing or agency on the other ;  or input and output .	None
55	argument	4	Moreover ,  rather as substance dualism tends to do ,  it seems to undermine the causal role of consciousness in ,  for example ,  bringing about or influencing actions .  For the causal relations of events would be just the same irrespective of whether or not the causal chain temporarily took on a mental aspect  ( as in property dualism )  or  ( as in substance dualism )  went mental for a while .  A further telling	argument	against the dual aspect theory - and one that has been rarely noticed is that aspects are relative to viewpoints ; in other words , they emerge posterior to perceptions . They cannot ,  therefore ,  be invoked to explain perceptions ,  even less the manner in which perception is related to matter .  Most scientists implicitly ,  and the many philosophers explicitly ,  prefer identity  theories .	None
56	argument	4	The monotony of the individual neurones is irrelevant ;  what matters is the infinite variety of their combinations ,  of their patterns ,  which will become evident when we look at the nervous system at the right level .  I shall deal with the language of neurophysiological description shortly .  However , it is necessary to say a word or two here to refute this seemingly compelling	argument	. We are so used to hearing talk about the nervous system encoding the outside world that it is easy to forget that this is a metaphor and it is one that has no place in serious philosophical discussion of the mind - body problem or the philosophy of perception .  The reason the coding metaphor has such currency in contemporary talk about perception is that it seems to suggest a way in which very simple and apparently homogenous  elements such as nerve impulses can generate the richness and variety of consciousness .

57	argument	5	She cried out .  It was her nail scissors that she 'd been searching for days ,  lost under the hearthrug and pressing into her hip ;  and the cry was also her virginity ,  small and bewildered and gone .

58	argument	4	Having realised ,  I suspect ,  at least for the time being ,  that they are not going to get anywhere in their fight for equal prize money at Wimbledon or the French ,  the Women 's  Tennis Association have come up with another proposal which I know has support in some areas but which I certainly hope will also bite the dust .  What they want in future is 32 seeds in all the Grand Slam tournaments instead of the 16 they have at present .  Their	argument	is that it is good for the tournament , a s well as the players concerned , if as many as possible of the higher ranked competitors survive the early rounds . They also claim that the players have earned this protection by the performances in the rest of the year which have brought about their rankings .  In my view ,  to have 32 seeds ,  even in the men 's  singles where there is far greater depth of talent than among the women ,  cannot possibly be justified .	None
59	argument	2	Jim Coates Executive Director The British Schools LTA  The conflicts within British tennis As Wimbledon again approaches , the	arguments	about why British tennis is so poor still rage on , and are getting even more heated . The June issue of Tennis World was no exception ,  with letters and articles giving both sides of the picture being published ;  the only problem is that ,  in their own way ,  they are probably both right .  The LTA are spending more and more money and whilst the rest of the world gets stronger ,  our players get lower in the rankings .	None

61	argument	3	But 20 per cent of its hops are now in the form of oils and essences and it is a growing sector .  It may well be there is nothing wrong with hops in this form except that I find that brewers who use them ,  such as Whitbread and Charles Wells ,  produce beers with a bitterness that is a shade too harsh for my liking .  And David Gardner 's defence of processed hops does remind the listener powerfully of the	arguments	advanced by the brewers in the 1960s when they were replacing cask ale with keg beer . In the 1950s and 60s there were superb beers  if you caught them on the right day .  But they could be vinegar the next day ,  he said .	None
62	argument	4	We learn that climbing is about tenuous niches in the horizontal rather than scaling a sheer cliff ,  as the journalese has it .  It 's  about oases of control where there should be none .  It should come as no surprise then , that some of those who see bolting as fundamentally reducing the experience I 've outlined above , and which is our common heritage , should cast around for some solid	arguments	to counter its spread . Hence the great cry has gone up :  Leave the environment alone !  What are a few bolts beside the environmental devastation caused by a large quarry 	None
63	argument	5	These regular outbursts have inevitably had an effect beyond that intended .  If you start writing to councillors and start complaining that Sites of Special Scientific Interest are being damaged then broader interests are going to become involved .  Controversy and	argument	attract notoriety . In the spring a story appeared in The Observer  under the headline Power - drill rock climbers accused of vandalism ,  of how a minority were threatening the relationship between landowners and climbers as a whole .  The strapline above the story included the phrase mountaineering 's  image on slide .	None
64	argument	3	Recreational damage is cited by the CPRE as being short - term and minimal .  Chunks of the Peak District are being gobbled up and we 're worried about the environmental implication of drilling a few tiny holes .  And as for damage to an historic monument , to wit Dumbarton Rock , and the subject of the piece in The Observer , the photograph that appeared alongside it gives the lie to this self - generated	argument	. The climber is centre - frame ,  his offending bolts invisible ,  but in one corner and easily legible is a mess of graffiti !  Think about this scenario for a moment .	None
65	argument	5	Most climbers ,  French or whatever ,  are very happy to swop information and generally be helpful .

66	argument	4	These were mixed .  I was sad and angry that he should want to place a bolt and go so radically against the grain ;  sympathetic with Dave 's  strong conviction ;  peeved that my own route  Centrefold  had been usurped .  While acknowledging his	argument	for the bolt placement , I advised that he had done the route ; if others thought a bolt should be placed , let someone else go ahead and place it . Shortly afterwards Dave placed a protection bolt in the roof just above the pegs .

74	argument	3	It was a collection of essays designed to introduce la nouvelle critique  to ignorant English readers :  apart from the editors ,  the contributors included Julia Kristeva and Philippe Sollers ,  and there was an interview with Roland Barthes .  A polemical note is sounded in the unsigned preface .  It acknowledges that the following texts and their	arguments	are difficult , but the difficulty is not to be hidden  we ourselves have no right to hide it .  Nor ,  however ,  is it to be submitted to the terrorism or plain language ,  that mythical weapon or those who prefer the comforting repetition or the ideological caress ;  who do not want to READ .	None
75	argument	1	It is ,  however ,  written in a crusading spirit ,  without any critical distance ,  and it is informed ,  like Belsey 's  book ,  by the assumption that language  or literature  can give us no certain knowledge of the world .  Hawkes 's  polemical purpose becomes more and more apparent as the book develops :  it is to undermine ,  not only established literary study ,  but liberal humanism itself .  His	arguments	are fast - moving but inexact , and he engages in some wild flourishes of Hegelian grammar : Writing , in short , does not reproduce ' a reality beyond itself , nor does it reduce ' that reality . In its new freedom ,  it can be seen to cause a new reality to come into being   ( Hawkes 's  italics )  .  Or consider the density of trope and implication in the following :  New New Criticism would thus claim to respond to literature 's  essential nature in which signifiers are prised utterly free of signifieds ,  aiming ,  in its no - holds - barred  encounter with the text ,  for a coherence  and validity  of response ,  not objectivity and truth  ( Hawkes 's  italics )  .	None
76	argument	3	As I have remarked ,  Culler 's  Structuralist Poetics  encouraged some readers to think in terms of rapprochement  between the New and the Newer Criticism .  Anthony Easthope 's  Poetry as Discourse  offers a complex blend of old and new .  He takes poststructuralist assumptions about the death of the author and the disappearance of the self - subsistent ego , and applies them to the history of English poetry , in a work which combines ingenious close reading , impressive knowledge of metre , and an overall	argument	of stratospheric thinness and remoteness . Easthope believes that the modernist concept of impersonality ,  later systematized in the New Criticism ,  and theorized by Wimsatt and Beardsley in their famous essay The Intentional Fallacy ,  was on the right lines ,  but did not go far enough ,  as the author was not really banished .  Some of Easthope 's  approach recalls that of C. S. Lewis in The Personal Heresy  .	None
77	argument	1	The breakdown of English intellectual insularity is welcome in principle ,  but a few things need to be said about this new turn to France .  It has become common form to invoke the magic names of the French theorists ,  as if the names alone would cause a torpid academic establishment to collapse .  The use of names rather than	arguments	as ammunition has become noticeable in such exercises , on both sides of the Atlantic , as Chris Baldick remarks in a review of Frederick Crews 's Skeptical Engagements : One lamentable practice which Crews rightly scorns is the increasingly revived trick or medieval rhetoric in which one attempts to substantiate one 's  theoretical argument not by anything so vulgarly empirical as a fact or a text but merely by invoking a name from the sacred pantheon .  Derrida ,  Foucault ,  Kristeva ,  Lacan ,  Barthes :  just reeling off their names is  ( as Auden said in a very different context )  ever so comfy ,  since it safely defers the issues at hand to nothing less than a transcendent signified :  in short ,  to a star .

This clinging to authority has ,  in my experience ,  become noticeable in graduate students and young academics in the past ten years or so .	None
79	argument	4	Interestingly ,  Anthony Easthope acknowledges the distinction at one point in Poetry as Discourse  :  Failure to distinguish clearly between signified and referent ,  the object it may refer to ,  has led to serious confusion in some accounts of the ideogram .  Yet it is a confusion he frequently falls into elsewhere ,  as do other New Accents writers .  Tallis 's case is convincing , though he has certainly not said the last word on the matter , and there may well be further	arguments	from those who are professionally engaged in linguistics . There is interesting supporting material in a book by the American critic Robert Scholes ,  Textual Power  ,  published in 1985 and not consulted by Tallis .  In Tallis 's  reading ,  Saussure did not move from the sign ,  which comprised signifier + signified ,  to reference ,  because he was not interested in doing so ,  being concerned only with the internal aspects of a language - system .	None
80	argument	2	He did not intend to exclude  reality .  The error lies with Saussure 's  expositors .  Scholes , however , believes that Saussure is himself inconsistent , and responsible for later confusion , but the thrust of his	argument	is very close to Tallis 's , and both of them are concerned as were Thurley and Nuttall to reinstate the validity of reference and to deny that language is a system of pure differences , without relation to reality . Scholes provides a useful table ,  divided into three columns ,  showing how linguists and philosophers have agreed in making a tripartite division between signifier ,  signified ,  and reference ,  though they present it in a variety of terminologies .  For Frege ,  it was Expression ,  Sense ,  Reference  (  Ausdruck ,  Sinn ,  Bedeutung )   .	None
81	argument	2	Some of this writing is acute and interesting ,  the product of lively minds with genuine insights into the state of contemporary culture .  I would often rather read it than more conventional forms of literary scholarship .  Yet it is frequently open to pragmatic self - refutation : it argues against reason by the processes of reason , and a political cause , however radical , cannot be advanced without the traditional processes of	argument	and attending to evidence . There is admittedly the playfulness of some versions of deconstructionist rhetoric ,  which read like prose - poetry .  But such texts are subject to the limitations of purely aesthetic discourse ,  with no through road to action ,  and must become politically suspect .	None
82	argument	2	Sinfield believed that they were often irredeemably tainted by ideology ,  at best to be read only in historical terms ,  or subject to symptomatic readings ,  seeking the fractures and fissures in the mystified surface of the text that showed the true ideological conditions in which it was produced .  Against this ,  Ryan advanced the humanistic belief that the major canonical texts are not inherently reactionary ,  and that they contain implicit images and models of human freedom which transcend their immediate historical context and which later readers can respond to .  This is an interestingly eclectic	argument	which recalls Gadamer on the fusion of horizons ( the reader 's and the text 's ) , Marcuse on the utopian possibilities of high culture , and Sartre on the necessarily progressive implications of major literature . Ryan represents a kind of Marxism that non - Marxists might do business with ,  in the sense that one can make a rational engagement with it .  This is not always the case .	None
83	argument	1	It is never very apparent what Freudian claims are based on ,  though they are widely accepted in our culture .  My scepticism has been reinforced by the recent work of Frederick Crews ,  who for many years was a leading psychoanalytic critic in America .  During the 1970s he began to lose faith in the whole Freudian programme , and in his recent book , Skeptical Engagements , he provides detailed and substantially supported	arguments	for abandoning it . Freud is not ,  however ,  likely to be generally rejected ,  since he is so much part of the valued cultural furniture of the West .  Furthermore ,  attacks such as Crews 's  are ,  as he acknowledges ,  not taken seriously and replied to in their own terms ,  but treated as symptoms of repressed disturbance .	None
84	argument	1	Nevertheless ,  Raymond Tallis ,  whose own training is in medicine ,  has shown to what extent one of Lacan 's  key concepts ,  the importance of the mirror stage in the development of the infant 's  sense of self ,  has no base in clinical experience .  As far as Tallis is concerned ,  Lacan is a charlatan ,  the L. Ron Hubbard of psychoanalysis .  Yet his system , like others on the contemporary scene , is constructed so as to repel	argument	or contrary evidence . Bowie ,  whose admiration is tinged with honest caution ,  has summed up the Lacanian system in these words :  Just as you can gain access to the cave of the unconscious only by being inside already ,  he seems to be saying ,  so you can gradually reach towards an understanding of my work only by understanding it in advance .	None
85	argument	1	Much of the work that is rediscovered may have the literary qualities that will satisfy readers without particular feminist interests :  the poems by women that Roger Lonsdale included in The New Oxford Book of Eighteenth - Century Verse  are a small - scale ,  easily accessible instance .  Nevertheless ,  in a feminist academic context writing may well be studied ,  not primarily for its literary but for its cultural interest .  This question provoked	arguments	in America about the Norton Anthology of Literature by Women , some of the contents of which were said to have had little value as literature . A common feminist response is to say that the whole idea of literary standards ,  even standards as such ,  is a form of male domination .  I refer to this significant dispute in passing ,  without engaging in it ,  except to say that feminists are divided on whether they want to establish a countercanon or extend the existing one .	None
86	argument	2	These phrases ,  and others like them ,  have been debated and pondered ,  interpreted and reinterpreted ,  as though they were the formulations of the great philosophers of the past ,  like Plato or Kant ,  rather than the work of a living thinker in mid - career .  There is a sense in which interpretation without conclusion is a mode of play ;  deconstruction insists that philosophical texts must be read as though they were literary texts ,  with full attention to their ambiguities and irresolutions .  In this light ,	arguments	about the interpretation of , say , Eliot 's poetry . Indeed ,  it is a central assumption of deconstruction that the distinction between literature and philosophy is exaggerated ,  or arbitrary ,  or even meaningless .  Certainly ,  some of Derrida 's  later work ,  such as The Post Card  ,  looks more like experimental literature than philosophy in the normal sense .	None
87	argument	2	Anyone who can say so clearly just what Derrida is saying ,  or doing ,  immediately puts the reader in his debt .  Yet the clarity and rigour may in themselves be problematical .  This was the position argued some years ago by practitioners of la nouvelle critique , who believed that clarity in	argument	was a form of ideological mystification , reinforcing the status quo . Put in such extreme terms ,  the position is clearly absurd and self - defeating .  But ,  for Derrida ,  whose fusion  or  ( con )  fusion  of obscurity and playfulness is an essential element in his textuality ,  Norris 's  exposition may represent a process of intellectual tidying up which leaves out something important .	None
88	argument	1	In America fashion can actually be enforced .  A few years ago ,  as part of an annual round - up of critical books for Encounter  ,  I reviewed an interestingly speculative work on modern fiction by an American academic .  My feelings about the book were positive rather than the reverse , but I complained in my review that it was studded with references to fashionable French gurus that were purely cosmetic , adding nothing to the author 's	argument	. A year or so later I chanced to meet him and he acknowledged that this was just criticism ,  but that he had been obliged to insert these names so that his book would look like a truly up - to - date ,  intouch work of scholarship .  In 1982 at Stanford I heard similar accounts of academic publishers requiring appropriate names and references in books .	None
89	argument	1	Marxists invoke History as a transcendent signified ,  the ultimate in terms of which everything else is to be explained ;  but there are many histories ,  not one ,  and we choose those which suit us .  As Edward Pechter puts it ,  History does not tell us what the text is ,  because we decide what history is ,  and then put history into the text ,  rather than the other way round .  Something similar is true of politics , another transcendent signified and	argument	- stopper . Since politics is traditionally one of the major defining activities of a rational humanity ,  the discussion of literature in political terms is not only possible but desirable ,  as the major critics of the past have shown .  But the word politics itself needs to be deconstructed ,  since politics is to do with our ideals of what human life should be ,  about which there has never been agreement ;   indeed ,  it is out of the disagreement that politics arises .	None
90	argument	1	He believes that literary study has a cultural and humane rather than an intellectual value ;  and the implication of his recent work is that there are other ways of attaining cultural value .  This has some affinity with the Marxist position .  In a published	argument	between Scholes and Hirsch , the former made the following statement , on the assumption that the conservative Hirsch would disagree with it : At the heart my belief is the conviction that no text  is so trivial as to be outside the bounds of humanistic study .  The meanest graffito ,  if fully understood ,  can be a treasure of human expressiveness	None
91	argument	4	Scholes is not a Marxist ,  but his American cultural populism has affinities with recent Marxist writing ;  at the same time ,  Hirsch and Scholes find themselves in unexpected agreement .  One might reach out to other affinities .  When Scholes writes that no text is so trivial as to be outside the bounds of humanistic study , I am reminded of C. S. Lewis 's	argument	that any piece of writing has a claim to being literary if someone can read it in a literary i.e. an absorbed , attentive , loving fashion . The effect of all these approaches is to remove literature ,  as conventionally defined ,  canonized ,  institutionalized ,  and taught ,  from the exclusive and isolated position which it has long occupied in the anglophone academy .  Even the modest proposal that literature should be read in its cultural context has large implications .	None
92	argument	4	Literariness is to be found as a basic principle in the work of the Russian Formalists and the New Critics ,  and ,  elaborately formulated ,  in Frye 's  Anatomy of Criticism  .  It inevitably presents itself in formalistic terms ,  and sometimes in overtly aesthetic ones .  The latter presentation is not so common , because of the generally unfavourable associations of aesthetic in our culture , though it is implied whenever students are asked to approach a poem as a work of art , rather than as an historical document or a philosophical	argument	. Indeed ,  a diluted Croceanism underlies much of our critical and pedagogic discourse ,  with its references to expression ,  feelings ,  intuitions ,  and unique personal responses .  Poems are more plausibly referred to as works of art than novels ;  the latter may have obviously aesthetic qualities ,  but have many other things in them as well .	None
93	argument	4	Something of the sort has already been introduced into some English degrees ,  under the aegis of the Verbal Arts Association ,  who have made a welcome start with such work .  The reading of English poetry would be accompanied by a consideration of historical as well as current theories of poetry .  These would include the	arguments	of the major poet - critics of the past : Sidney , Jonson , Dryden , Johnson , and on to the Romantics , Victorians , and modernists . I cannot see how the canon of poetry could avoid being constructed along historical lines ,  though the problem and implications of canon - formation should be faced ,  as part of theoretical study .  It could take account of recent attempts to enlarge the canon ,  particularly by the addition of poetry by women ,  and other marginalized groups .	None
94	argument	4	Reviewing and criticism are separate activities ,  but the best literary journalism can provide genuine and valuable criticism ,  as Morris Dickstein has pointed out .  What is needed are more journals that are prepared to publish long ,  serious ,  reflective essays or review - articles ,  as the London Review of Books  does .  Victoria Glendinning , writing as a biographer and literary journalist , has offered some judicious thoughts on the question , which summarize much of my	argument	: No one could doubt that the application of the academic mind to literature has been salutary in bringing rigour and discipline into criticism :  cleaner texts ,  scholarly annotations ,  precise analysis ,  intelligent  even transforming  interpretations and readings ;  and an intolerance for woolly emotional responses ,  vague inflated recommendations ,  and subjective wallowings of all kinds .  But the academic mind ,  and the exigencies of the academic career ,  have had the effect of splitting off academic approaches to literature from the reading ,  in that word 's  widest sense ,  of ordinary people	None
95	argument	4	Mr Noel Stock ,  who speaks as one who had Pound 's  confidence in recent years and was in daily contact with him ,  explains that this passage derives from a hint thrown out by Jessie L. Weston in her from Ritual to Romance  ,  to the effect that the charges of heresy brought against the Templars were not wholly unfounded ,  since some of the practices of the Eleusinian mystery - cults from the pagan Near East survived in the heart of Christendom in the rituals of the Templars ,  a survival to be traced in literature in the stories and poems about the quest of the holy grail .  From Ritual to Romance  came out in 1920 ,  and was a new book when T.S. Eliot borrowed from it for The Waste Land , thus making it permanently famous ; Pound could not have known of it in 1911 , but if he had then visited the Templars ' cavern - church in Aubeterre he could hardly have failed to remember it in the light of jessie Weston 's	argument	. Certainly in recent years Pound 's  interest in mystery - cults has been more than antiquarian ;  in was Erigena ours   he asks whether the philosopher Scotus Erigena was one of the Eleusinian brotherhood ,  and ours can be given full weight  Noel Stock goes so far as to claim  ( op .  cit .  p.22 )  that some of the obscurity of these later Cantos is deliberate and arcane  he writes about them as an initiate in words that are both published and not published .  Fascinating as this is ,  it is surely with relief that we return from thus checking printed source against printed source ,  cross - referring and tentatively identifying ,  to the open air of the roads of France .	None
96	argument	4	The story is an intricate one ,  as Herbert Schneidau acknowledges ;  and Pound 's  holding out against Ford for the Dantesque principle of a curial diction  ( see his introduction to the poems of Lionel Johnson )  represents to my mind an objection that can still be raised to Ford 's  principles of diction ,  salutary as Ford 's  polemics undoubtedly were for Pound at this time .  Moreover Prothero ,  a historian ,  perhaps had no ideas about poetic diction one way or the other ;  Pound ,  as we have seen ,  thought himself victimized by Prothero not for anything to do with writing but for having championed Lewis the painter and Gaudier the sculptor .  All the same Schneidau 's	argument	is just and illuminating , so far as it goes . But does it go far enough   It is worth looking again at Pound 's  letter to Michael Roberts ,  strident though it is .	None
97	argument	4	If we resent this  ( as we should )  ,  we ought to realize that it is we who are to blame for it .  For neither Kenner nor Pound is a professional or obsessive Anglophobe .  Both men are reporting what seem to them the facts of the case , and they are the more confident about doing so because no Englishman has arisen to rebut their	arguments	. For us to respond with sneering anti - Americanism is the merest childishness .  After this ,  Pound 's  relations with England and the English were for the most part an aspect of his relations with that one of his erstwhile protgs who had become ,  surprisingly ,  a pillar of the English establishment  Eliot ,  editor of the Criterion  .	None
98	argument	4	All  his pride in his memory ,  his sense of the internationale of writers ,  painters ,  musicians ,  and the aristocrats ,  his study of form as technique  ( no contours ,  no edges ,  intellectual concepts ,  but rounding ,  thrusting ,  as a splash of color ,  as Yeats described his aim in the Cantos )  it is all a huge AESTHETICISM ,  ending in hate for Jews ,  Reds ,  change ,  the content and matter often of disaster ,  a loss of future ,  and in that a fatality as death - full as those for whom the atom bomb is Armageddon ,  not Apocalypse .  Again ,  Pound 's  admirers will protest ;  and they will be right ,  insofar as  Yeats 's  account of the Cantos  is n't so definitive as Olson takes it to be .  But the main thrust of Olson 's	argument	is unaffected , and it ca n't be set aside : this great American poet ( and Olson knows that Pound is all of that ) was a Fascist , profoundly , and no amount of talk about his affinities with Whitman will save him for democracy , nor will any attempt to treat his anti - Semitism as an unrelated pathological aberration . Another escape hatch that Olson slams shut upon us is the device of distinguishing between Pound - the - man and Pound - the - poet .  The trouble with this manoeuvre is that it cannot help but demote poetry .	None
99	argument	4	An instance ,  and a momentous one ,  is Tate 's  review in Poetry  for November 1932 ,  of Pound 's  How To Read  :  The real criticism of Mr Pound is not to be directed against his theory as such ,  but rather at the hasty headlong fashion  in which he presents it ,  at the logical confusion of his intellect when it is not performing the task which is specifically his own ,  that task being poetry .  The justification of Mr Pound 's thesis in How To Read is not his	arguments	, but his poetry . Leavis ,  who countered How To Read  with a booklet ,  How to Teach  Reading  ,  and Winters ,  who declared in 1937 ,  Mr Pound resembles a village loafer who sees much and understands little ,  told the same story as Tate :  Pound was a naf  ,  an imagination and sensory apparatus that consistently performed better than it knew ,  in ways that the maker 's  own discursive intelligence failed to comprehend or measure up to ;  in Winters 's  memorable and mordant judgement of 1943 ,  a sensibility without a mind ,  or with as little mind as is well possible .  Take Pound the poet  ( though in strictly limited dosages ,  if you listened to Leavis or Winters )  ,  and ignore Pound the critic  the message was loud and clear ,  and it was attended to .	None
100	argument	2	The choreography likewise evokes changes of weather and mood but without displaying any overt narrative development .  The two central ,  baggy - suited dancers ,  Lynne Bristow and William Trevitt ,  either mirror each others '  movements  ( the old man perhaps communing with his diary )  or else dance as a couple  ( the man reliving past relationships )  .  Thus some slow , desiccated waltzing and gentle leans have the quietude of an old couple on a dull mild day ; sequences of deft , steppy footwork and sharp edged leaps have the high spirits of blustery sunshine , while a duet of rhythmic fidgety gestures has the feel of a lifelong	argument	continued during a rainy afternoon . The other four dancers regularly interrupt or echo these sequences with images from the past  a robust trio ,  whose folk steps and causally thrown jumps have the coltish energy of adolescence and two couples who look like lovers courting in the 1920s .  By the end this quartet depart the stage in a halting dance of death and Trevitt is rolled up in a carpet ,  leaving Bristow alone without partner or diary .	None
101	argument	4	Britain 's  kind of deficit arises not because the Government needs to borrow ;  the public sector itself is in heavy surplus .  The deficit is created by the actions of the private sector .  If so his	argument	goes consenting adults in the private sectors of different countries lend money to each other , all that shows is that capital markets are usefully redirecting the surplus savings of one economy to the investment opportunities in another . That detached observer ,  the International Monetary Fund ,  calls this kind of deficit efficient and self - correcting .  History shows it can go on for a long time ,  as deficits and surpluses did during the golden age before the First World War .	None
102	argument	2	History shows it can go on for a long time ,  as deficits and surpluses did during the golden age before the First World War .  Very recent history suggests the world has become much more like that again ,  with investment in each country breaking free from the constraint of domestic savings .  Evidence of excessive demand There is some observable good sense in this	argument	, and it helps to explain why sterling has not hit the fan a lot earlier , during a truly spectacular swing from surplus to deficit over the past two years . But its limits are exposed by asking a simple question :  why ,  then ,  should Mr Lawson not be quite happy to see the deficit get even larger   Why should a good deficit not get even better 	None
103	argument	2	Today there is again a global capital market ,  but no gold standard ,  no fixed exchange rates ,  for Britain not even a European Monetary System .  That is not Mr Lawson 's  fault ,  of course ,  but he has to live with the danger that while the world 's  capital markets will duly bridge the gap between Britain 's  domestic savings and investment ,  they will only do so at a lower price for sterling .  If you take the	argument	about consenting adults to its logical conclusion , that price Britain 's exchange rate should be left to them , too . But however suspicious Mrs Thatcher may be of managed exchange rate systems ,  she dislikes a falling pound as much as anyone .  So we come back around the circle to the capital side of the balance of payments ,  and the operationally interesting question :  for how long can we expect the world 's  savers to make up our domestic shortage 	None
104	argument	4	It is ,  he argues ,  not at all clear how you raise private savings to close the other kind of gap .  This point should not be pushed to perversity :  the IMF is still clear that a US - style deficit is worse ,  and it certainly is not being quickly corrected .  But Mr Lawson has to show he knows how to do the trick , before he can win his	argument	, in theory or in the markets .

105	argument	4	As the Indian example shows ,  domestic consumption is a vital factor .  Yet one must be cautious .  Historically tea has been a fairly dull market , dominated by trade interests two	arguments	against the London Fox 's efforts to excite interest in a tea futures contract . A balanced market ,  by definition ,  can swing surprisingly fast in the opposite direction :  the chances are ,  for example ,  that Malawi will not have a drought next year .  But for all I know ,  the ICO could still be meeting then .	None
106	argument	2	Rational judgement might have told him that the nation 's  plight was hopeless ,  but his was the vision of an avenging prophet .  It is probable ,  Storr observes ,  that England owed her survival in 1940 to this inner world of make - believe .  What psychoanalysis calls fantasies of infantile omnipotence thus came into play , together with other attributes of infantility greed , paranoia , and an inability to follow complex rational	arguments	. Churchill demanded that all ideas be submitted to him on a half - sheet of paper ;  he was frequently insensitive ,  a bad judge of character ,  and a sucker for flamboyant charlatans ;  intensely loyal ,  he demanded uncritical loyalty in return .  The end of the war meant the end of the blissful congruence between fantasy and reality ,  and Churchill turned to painting and writing in an effort to regain that happy state .	None
107	argument	2	The classic example of market failure is environmental protection .  Education and training and research and development are other areas where government intervention is badly needed .  The dilapidation of our transport system and the shoddy state of our national services underlines the	argument	for more public investment . Labour 's  change of policy on the European Community puts it in a strong position to argue that economic and industrial decisions are increasingly likely to be made on a European basis and it is essential that Britain plays a more constructive role .  We shall need to develop ,  for example ,  a viable policy on economic and monetary union .	None
108	argument	4	But after 10 years of Tory rule ,  he had had enough of that approach to politics .  Labour would be acquiescing in a democratic outrage if it continued arguing that ,  because the Conservatives had got away with being undemocratic for so long ,  it was now Labour 's  turn .  Mr Cook also countered the	argument	that PR would build in a pull towards the centre ground , preventing Labour from implementing a radical programme . It seemed strange to make that argument ,  Mr Cook said ,  when it was clear the whole policy review process was designed to placate the centre ground .  I cannot honestly see that a system which would require us to compromise the morning after the election is really so morally inferior to a system which has already obliged us to compromise our policies two years before polling day .	None
109	argument	4	Some recent work on green vervet monkeys shows that audience effects can be important in other contexts in which their functional significance is a little easier to identify .  Anne Keddy Hector ,  Robert Seyfarth and Michael Raleigh at the Universities of California and Pennsylvania have been studying parental behaviour among captive vervets to see if males '  parental ability affected the females '  choice of mate .  Their	argument	was that a male 's potential quality as a parent might be important because , in many species of Old World monkeys , males form strong protective relationships with females and their young , which are crucial in reducing the amount of harassment and competition the young suffer from other members of the group . In a number of species ,  bonds between males and infants within a group may influence the chances of males mating with certain females .  In baboons and Japanese macaques mothers resuming their sexual cycle are more likely to mate with males who have formed a relationship with their offspring .	None
110	argument	5	That will be the guiding light of the next Labour government .  When I insist on that priority ,  as I can tell you I most certainly will  with the full support of the Prime Minister in doing so  then I 'm sure my colleagues will see the point of that .  Now it is quite right of them , of course , to allow our social obligations not to be forgotten ; there 'll probably be an	argument	. There are in all governments between the Treasury and spending ministers .  But they will take into account the need for that balance that says that social spending without underpinning by economic growth will not be sustained in any event .	None
111	argument	5	In the absence of the big idea ,  one good phrase would be a help ,  something to focus the uncertain and suggestible mood of the country and put its finger on what it is that is missing and wanted after 10 years of Mrs Thatcher .  By the end of this week we shall know what the Labour Party no longer stands for ,  such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and full - scale nationalisation ;  but what ,  in essence ,  does it stand for   If it did not exist , would anyone trouble to invent it at a time when , from the Atlantic to the Urals , socialism in all its manifestations is losing the	argument	to liberal capitalism  For we should not become too carried away by Labour 's  changed face and tone of voice ,  nor too dazzled by the Peter Mandelson image - conjuring .  The party may have put on a collar and tie but it is still the Labour Party ,  prone to its old reflexes  ( as it reminded us yesterday on defence spending )  ,  prisoner still of its anachronistic structure ,  its mind set in 100 years of working -  class history .	None
112	argument	4	Some Anglicans would certainly go further :  the Bishop of Birmingham ,  the Right Rev Mark Santer ,  who is the Anglican co - chairman of the theological commission trying to overcome doctrinal differences between the two Churches ,  says :  If Anglicans and other non - Roman Catholics really do believe that the Christian Church is called to be at peace with itself ,  how  given the fact that Christians are sinful  do you actually keep the show together   In the end ,  you do have to have some sort of juridical power if you are going to keep the institution together .  This a very English and pragmatic	argument	for the necessity of a central authority in the Church . It has been greatly influenced by the tangled confusion into which the Anglican Communion has stumbled over the ordination of women .  It starts from the fact of disunity and asks which existing political mechanism can work best for unity .	None
113	argument	2	Environmental organisations ,  however ,  put the emphasis elsewhere .  There is no incinerator which completely destroys toxic wastes ,  Madeleine Cobbing ,  Greenpeace 's  toxics campaigner ,  told me .  The crux of our	argument	is that we do n't need to have toxic wastes and the fact that plants like Rechem exist , providing easy options for companies , is acting as a disincentive for companies to clean up. But  another but  what about the PCBs that already exist   Although they are no longer manufactured ,  they are still present ,  for example in electrical equipment .	None
114	argument	2	Although they are no longer manufactured ,  they are still present ,  for example in electrical equipment .  No one could therefore call for the closure of incineration plants at a stroke ,  because noxious chemicals have to go somewhere .  So a part of the	argument	switches to the kind of incinerators you allow while industry is forced to clean itself up. Also ,  how these should function and  perhaps most important of all  where you put them .  Mr Wheeler ,  now moving to the rear of the plant to show off the 2m smoke - cleaning section ,  which had just broken down ,  pointed out that his company achieved destruction of at least 99.9999 per cent of all materials .	None
115	argument	4	If South Africa or a South American country made a pitch for Hong Kong entrepreneurs ,  numbers could rise sharply yet again .  It is a matter of principle for the Hong Kong government that it should not seek to restrict the numbers leaving ,  whether directly or by influencing resettlement countries .  But , particularly since Tiananmen , it has been echoing the	argument	that people would be less concerned to leave Hong Kong before 1997 if they could be absolutely confident that other countries would accept them after that date . The Governor ,  Sir David Wilson ,  has argued for a general right of entry to Britain  though such a right could not be of much value if it were not ordinarily convertible into full citizenship .  Officials also talk of an armageddon scenario ,  asking that Britain secure international agreement to accommodate millions of Hong Kong refugees in the event of Tiananmen - style repression after 1997 .	None
116	argument	4	Already ,  President George Bush is talking about a full restoration of Sino - US relations .  Other nations ,  especially Japan ,  wait impatiently in the wings with their offers of soft loans .  To those who see China in primarily economic terms , the golden goose	argument	comes most easily : that its government would never be so foolish as to constrict or repress Hong Kong , the tiny territory which has proved such a powerful catalyst for the growth of its hinterland . In eight years ,  such optimists claim ,  China will be adjusting to Hong Kong ,  rather than vice versa .  Great tracts of the Middle Kingdom will be virtually indistinguishable from the tiny entrepreneurial enclave .	None
117	argument	2	It is easy enough to say What Makes Martin Run :  a sincere belief that Hong Kong needs true democracy ,  even if most of its present leaders disagree .  The more difficult question is how long he can continue as a one - man movement .  He has been one of the Legislative Council 's most diligent members , a demanding enough job ; he accepted China 's offer of a seat on the Basic Law Drafting Committee , helping to write Hong Kong 's post - 1997 mini - constitution , and was embroiled in more unsuccessful	arguments	for direct elections , opposed by mainland communists and Hong Kong conservatives . He has been an energetic supporter of the democracy movement in China ;  and of Hong Kong campaigns to secure right of abode in Britain .  Not surprisingly ,  from time to time ,  his fatigue shows :  the voice cracks ,  the temper frays ,  the judgement falters .	None
118	argument	2	As Senna raced towards the victory he needed in Spain on Sunday ,  James Hunt ,  a driver familiar with the pressures of a late challenge for the championship ,  was saying Senna had no right to be on the track at all .  Or ,  at least ,  not if you compare Senna 's  comparatively lenient fine for ignoring a warning flag last Friday with the harsh justice delivered to Nigel Mansell earlier in the week .  The	argument	is that Senna 's crime as he rushed past the scene of an accident was infinitely more dangerous than Mansell 's failure to stop on the command of a black flag . Although guaranteed the drivers '  championship ,  McLaren are on a loser no matter what happens .  If Prost wins ,  then he takes the title with him to Ferrari and ,  in exchange for the highly desirable numbers 1 and 2 the Italians will present 27 and 28 to McLaren ,  a particularly irksome detail for such a dominant team to accept .	None
119	argument	4	That ,  in my opinion ,  is dead right .  But the important quality about Dick Crossman ,  which made him unique among Members of Parliament and made his testament to the understanding of British Government unique ,  is that he was the pure ,  100 per cent archetypal don ,  a don through and through ,  albeit a don whose special subject was politics in practice .  Crossman tended to presume that all those he came across , at work or socially , liked nothing better than to have their intellectual sacred cows challenged , their	arguments	questioned and their assumptions subjected to loud investigation . That is the portrait of a don ,  a don in his supreme incarnation ,  a don going about the business that he was designed for by nature .  Of course ,  as should be the way with a don ,  he excited dismay  -  dismay more than dislike or distrust .	None
120	argument	2	From Lady JANE HOWARD Sir :  Professor Gomme  ( letter ,  3 October )  argues the case for the exact recreation of the interior of Uppark most cogently ;  and certainly ,  careful and committed reconstruction ,  such as can be seen at Chatelherault where Hamilton district council has faithfully ,  and against all the odds ,  achieved a marvellous reproduction of William Adam 's  hunting lodge for the fifth Duke of Hamilton ,  is not to be jeered at .  But Anna Pavord 's recognition ( 27 September ) of the opportunity for the twentieth century boldly to turn Uppark 's tragedy to advantage , is a more compelling	argument	. Why not create an exhibition centre inside a perfectly restored exterior for exhibitions of all that is best in furnishings in National Trust ownership  -  a Burrell within a Claverton   There could be exhibitions of the best tapestries and textiles ,  the finest portraiture ,  the most outstanding silver ;  or the best of a certain period drawn together from National Trust houses ;  and perhaps linked displays on craftmanship ,  techniques ,  restoration and conservation .

121	argument	2	Why the need for such an ambitious plan now   It 's  the last hoorah of the economic regulators ,  he said .

On a good day the climate in LA is close to perfection :  it is possible to understand what brought all these millions to a vast ,  waterless ,  resourceless basin ,  between the mountains ,  the desert and the sea .

122	argument	4	He ,  like other founders of the paper ,  fears that if the damages award is not lowered considerably it could be the end of the road for Pressdram Ltd ,  the Eye 's  publisher ,  after decades of public wars with the great and the powerful .

123	argument	2	There are two kinds of violence  good or bad .  It 's  the difference between the person who knocks you down to take your purse and the person who knocks him down to come to your rescue .  Burrows believes that smacking is as necessary as kissing and cuddling , and finds it ironic that the same kind of	arguments	about parents not knowing when to stop are used to undermine our instincts in both cases . She says :  Smacking is a way of educating the aggressive instincts of children .  Aggression is n't something children learn from their parents ,  they are born with it .	None
124	argument	4	Forest had been comfortable enough for most of the first half .  They went ahead in the 30th minute when Tommy Gaynor skipped away from a couple of tackles and let fly from 25 yards :  no sign of gratitude there for Eoin Hand ,  Huddersfield 's  manager ,  who had helped along his fellow - Irishman 's  career in the early days at Limerick .  Hand 's team , however , replied impressively seven minutes later when Maskell , transfer - listed at his own request after scoring 33 goals last season , scored his first of this , Cecere laying the ball off to the ambitious young man whose crisp drive was a powerful	argument	for a rise in status . Forest regained the lead four minutes into the second half when Gary Crosby ,  chasing Nigel Clough 's  clever pass ,  swept past Chris Hutchings and poked the ball between Steve Hardwick 's  legs .  It seemed all over in the 63rd minute when Clough ,  a few yards outside the penalty area ,  volleyed a headed clearance instantly into the roof of the net before Hardwick could move a muscle .	None
125	argument	2	The slowdown in military spending and escalating costs of armament programmes will make it increasingly difficult for any company ,  even one the size of BAe ,  to go it alone .  The recent improvement in East - West relations must also make the market for military equipment less favourable .  But as Professor Smith himself notes , there is one important caveat to this	argument	. Any increased concentration among defence suppliers will depend crucially on the attitudes of individual governments .  Past experience suggests that some governments ,  at least ,  may not be prepared to sit this one out .	None
126	argument	2	In drawing attention to many such embarrassments ,  Davie 's  book is sure to provoke a good deal of rancour in certain circles .  Yet it would not be quite right to call Under Briggflatts controversial ,  for that deadened word implies a self - serving wish to shock which is far from Davie 's  considered anger .  And if Davie 's principles make him what some might call elitist or undemocratic , as in his stinging verdicts on catchpenny enterprises like the Arvon Poetry Competitions , it is not without his having pondered the	arguments	about the place and function of elites and of high art in a democratic nation far more deeply than the bulk of his fellow countrymen . Just as importantly ,  he is possessed of a generosity of mind which allows him to be calmly judicious about the merits of writers who can advocate militant homosexuality and drug - taking  ( such as Thom Gunn )  ,  sympathise with feminism  ( Elaine Feinstein )  or adhere to some variant of Marxism  ( Hugh MacDiarmid )  .  Both in his sternness and in his generosity ,  Davie is strongly reminiscent of a much earlier writer ,  whose name is invoked towards the end of Under Briggflatts .	None
127	argument	4	A simpler solution than electoral reform is to abandon the policies and attitudes which have barred Labour from power ,  which is what Mr Kinnock has been about .  An unholy alliance with other minorities to preserve ideological positions otherwise unacceptable to the electorate does not appeal as a noble enterprise .  Refuting the	argument	that proportional representation would mean trimming to minority centrist positions , Robin Cooke , one of Labour 's leading advocates of reform , said : We have already gone to endless lengths to placate the centre ground . Exactly .  A properly functioning two - party system has a centrifugal dynamic .	None
128	argument	4	The growth of third parties in the Seventies and early Eighties was in a large part a product of the malfunctioning of the two - party system ,  partly as a consequence of Mrs Thatcher 's  rejection of the post - war consensus but chiefly as a result of Labour 's  leftward lurches .  Mr Kinnock is correct to insist that fundamental changes in the voting system should not be undertaken for short - term ,  tactical reasons .  Nor is there much in the fairness	argument	, although this is the reason offered by 46 per cent of the people interested in PR . I cannot see that one voting system is intrinsically more fair than another .  It is not fair ,  perhaps ,  that with 23 per cent of the vote the Alliance should have won only 3 per cent of the seats in the House of Commons .	None

134	argument	5	Townshend is most famous for beating his guitar against speaker stacks ,  but it is also worth remembering that ,  on stage at The Ricky Tick Club ,  Windsor ,  in May 1966 ,  he attempted the same stunt against the head of Keith Moon .  For his part ,  Moon managed to fry a sizeable portion of Townshend 's  hair by misjudging a flash powder explosion in his drum kit during the making of an American TV Special .  The on - stage	arguments	and bust - ups practically became a feature of the show , with Daltrey almost permanently poised to quit , but somehow hanging on . And when they were n't trashing each other ,  they were trashing themselves .  Moon died in 1978 ,  after an overdose of the prescribed drug he was taking to ease himself out of alcoholism ;  Townshend had his own dark periods of excess ;  even Entwistle ,  the quiet ,  static one ,  felt inclined to release a solo album entitled Smash Your Head Against The Wall .	None
135	argument	4	At the moment ,  they are not encouraging .  The consumers would appreciate some stability .  Perhaps more variety , too , although enthusiasts ' assertions that not everyone is obsessed by the Big Five are countered by East who , as a football nut and a director of Derby until he moved into his current post , knows all the	arguments	. We 're not a public service ,  he says ,  and we wo n't attract viewers by going to half - empty stadiums .  They want to share in big - match atmosphere .	None
136	argument	4	On the other hand ,  a pro - rights clergyman suggested that it is our traditional despotic treatment of the non - human creation which has been truly infantile ,  and that it is only in this century that we have begun to grow up a little .  The programme scrupulously refused to attribute full maturity to either faction ,  dwelling on the bestial acts committed by animal rights terrorists  - the Bristol University bombing and so on  as well as on the vile surgical mutilations which had provoked them ,  and Ian Breach 's  presentation script was both deft and literate ;  a model guide through these complex issues .  But the very process of putting pictures to the	argument	tended to weight the case in favour of the critter lobby . It 's  easy to sway the emotions by showing monkeys with their brains cut open ,  genetically stunted pigs or smoking beagles ,  less so to drag on someone suffering from a vile disease and say this person will die unless we keep on chopping up small furry creatures .  ( Indeed ,  the anti - vivisectionists were allowed a small but notable coup on this score :  Sue Crowshaw ,  badly disabled by rheumatoid arthritis ,  made a moving speech denying scientists the right to claim they were experimenting on her behalf .  )	None
137	argument	4	BOOK REVIEW / Thatcher 's  early days on the seat of power :  Margaret ,  Daughter of Beatrice  Leo Abse :  Jonathan Cape ,  12.95 pounds By AUBERON WAUGH IN A LONG apologia for having had the temerity to undertake a psycho - biography of Mrs Thatcher , Leo Abse denies that his book is a personal attack on her , but agrees that it may have some admonitory function in warning people not to acquiesce too readily in the disposition of someone who would appear , on his	argument	, to be gravely unbalanced . His justification for the necessary invasion of privacy is the familiar  -  and thoroughly respectable  plea that politics should and must be personalised .  Politics has very little to do with issues ;  it is all to do with the personal vanities and ambitions of politicians .	None
138	argument	2	But this does not stop Abse constructing an elaborate thesis based on Thatcher 's  sphincter morality ,  for which her mother ,  Beatrice ,  should really take the blame :  Thatcher succeeded in initiating the electorate into a new form of gambling :  her personal need to end the earlier constraints which she had endured ,  outlawing the joys of shitting and coprophilia ,  drove her to open the doors of the Stock Exchange ,  and end its exclusivity .  This would seem a benign effect of Thatcher 's  bad potty training ,  except that Abse has a bee in his bonnet against gambling .  The second real objection to this form of psycho - biography is that as soon as Freud is quoted as gospel , the whole	argument	descends into music hall burlesque for everybody but dedicated Freudians . The aetiology of the urge to gamble lies in joyless masturbation and early ,  still - unresolved bisexuality ,  proclaims Abse ,  after Freud .  Most intelligent people who have not accepted Freudian indoctrination will ask him to tell that to the Marines .	None
139	argument	4	Her affection for the Bomb is explained by the fact that it is energy - charged and penis - shaped .  All of which is quite funny for a bit ,  but becomes boring because it is obviously such rubbish .  What is particularly boring about it is that all the	arguments	are circular . Having observed Thatcher 's  boorish behaviour ,  Abse comments :  Such a jealous and ruthless super - ego can only have been formed by a prohibiting mother who is brusque and prematurely insists upon early toilet training .  From that possibility ,  he goes on to blame bad potty - training for all her character defects .	None
140	argument	4	As Mr Torode points out ,  our liberal forefathers insisted on the importance of testing faiths by submitting them to discussion .  Liberal commitment to free speech must also be tested in this way ,  lest it become an unthinking orthodoxy  a mere article of faith .  To submit the free speech principle to such a test is not an	argument	for book - banning . It is a plea for consistency .  If we demand that the faiths of others be tested ,  how can we refuse to test our own 	None
141	argument	4	It was decided that Ajax should forfeit the tie and thereafter be excluded from European competition for the next two seasons for which they qualify .  The club 's  chairman ,  Michael Van Praag ,  who was not invited into the hearing ,  said that Ajax would accept the forfeit but appeal against the ban in Geneva next Friday .  He said : We have very good	arguments	to prove that we cannot be held responsible for the actions of a few people who did not know what they were doing . Security was more than 100 per cent .  There was a body check of every spectator .	None
142	argument	2	Racing :  Nisky to pass revision test By JOHN KARTER THE MISSING link reappears at Goodwood this afternoon in the shape of Ile De Nisky ( 2.45 ) , the horse who represents the prime piece of evidence in the	argument	over the comparative merits of Nashwan and Old Vic , writes John Karter . The fact that the English and Irish Derby winners will never meet on the track does not stop the followers of the dynamic duo hammering home their cases .  And if the form book is to be believed ,  Nashwan is clearly No. 1 because Ile De Nisky finished seven and a half lengths behind him at Epsom ,  but got a length nearer to Old Vic at The Curragh .	None
143	argument	4	During the debate Roy Hattersley ,  the deputy leader ,  argued that it would be historic folly for Labour to back proportional representation ;  inevitable coalitions would mean that we would never again have a Labour government that was able to carry out a Labour programme .  But advocates of PR said afterwards that the issue would not go away :  Labour has yet to decide its preferred method of electing its proposed regional assemblies and its replacement for the House of Lords .  Jeff Rooker , the MP for Birmingham Perry Barr , who retired from Labour 's front bench last year partly to campaign for PR , said : A lot more people went away from this conference convinced of the merits of the	argument	than is shown in the vote . Gavin Laird ,  the general secretary of the Amalgamated Engineering Union ,  said that it was the last burning issue Labour needed to resolve before the next election .  Mr Hattersley said during the debate that he and Neil Kinnock were more determined than ever to resist pressure for Labour to back PR ,  because voters would suspect that the party lacked confidence in its ability to win under the present system .	None
144	argument	2	They claimed that the director was the sole author of his films ,  and that the more strongly his personality and preoccupations were found in them ,  the greater he was .  With the exception of Hitchcock ,  whom they worshipped ,  they had little time for accepted and acclaimed directors ,  finding more value in the more commercial movies of ,  for instance ,  Howard Hawks and Raoul Walsh .  With a vigour amounting to tactlessness they put dissension and	argument	into film debate , too long overshadowed by blind acceptance of yesteryear 's taste . It took as long again for their theories to be discredited ,  despite the fact that almost none of their Hollywood idols would agree that they were the sole auteur of the films they made ;  while the greatest weakness of their belief was that the most flawed work by one of their preferred film - makers was of more interest than a major piece by one of those they did not rate .  Years later one of Cahiers '  most influential critics ,  Jean - Luc Godard ,  admitted that none of them had really believed in the theory ,  but had used it to draw attention to themselves .	None
145	argument	2	The Guardian and The Observer published details of the contents of the book in April 1986 and The Sunday Times published the first of a series of extracts in July 1987 .  The Government was represented at a hearing before the commission on Thursday by the Attorney General ,  Sir Patrick Mayhew QC .  It argues that the injunctions were necessary in the public interest to prevent the concept of the security service 's confidentiality being destroyed pending full	argument	at trial . The affair provoked a deep division of views when the case reached the Law Lords in July 1987 .  Lord Templeman said that sweeping aside the public interest factor without any trial would have established a charter for traitors to publish on the most massive scale in England whatever they had managed to publish abroad '	None
146	argument	5	At the technical run - through it looks perfect .  But Ninagawa stops the action every few minutes to make tiny adjustments .  This is where he comes alive , slithering lizard - like over the Lyttleton seats to issue instructions in a voice that brooks no	argument	. The impression is of final polishing after many months of gradual rehearsal .  In fact ,  Ninagawa takes just one month to direct a production and rehearses only five hours a day .	None
147	argument	2	Many of its difficulties will not be solved either by John Prescott 's  ideas for greater rail and bus use ,  or by Cecil Parkinson 's  new and wider motorways .  The only answer is to spread the people and the jobs thinner  so that fewer travellers ,  bringing their cars and their litter  -  journey into it or through it .  This is not an	argument	that should only concern South - easterners . Love it or hate it ,  the South - east does contain 30 per cent of the population of the United Kingdom .  It is the engine that drives the economy .	None
148	argument	5	But the declaration issued by the congress left no doubt that the decision was intended to be more than a mere facelift :  The present concept of socialism ,  the Stalinist system ,  has exhausted all its social ,  economic ,  political and moral reserves ,  and has proved unsuitable for keeping pace with global developments .  Thus the history of the HSWP as a state party has come to an end .  To sidestep any	arguments	about who should inherit the party 's vast fortunes if a split occurs , the delegates declared themselves to be the legal heirs of the HSWP , whilst dissociating themselves from the old party 's crimes , false and mistaken principles and methods . The founding document states that members of the old party will not automatically receive their new cards .  They will all have to apply and sign the HSP 's  statutes and programme .	None
149	argument	2	But the leaderships of the main factions consist almost entirely of sociologists and political scientists ,  all of whom have had to read Macchiavelli at one stage of their careers .  The compromise founding declaration which was approved on Saturday contains a line many Western socialist parties would be proud of :  The party wishes to contribute to the building of a social market economy based on mixed ownership .

151	argument	5	It is apparent that the voyage provoked conflict which the four are reluctant to talk about .  Mr Hellriegel says he does not care if he never sees Mr Glennie again .  Another crewman , Jim Nalepka , recalls bitter	arguments	over half a biscuit and confesses to having thoughts about slitting the throat of one of his friends . Four months at the mercy of the weather taught Mr Glennie to enjoy the moment .  I was free and in a way I was happy .	None
152	argument	4	At the Conservative Party Conference in 1986 ,  Norman Fowler ,  then Secretary of State for Health ,  produced a computer printout of 380 new large hospital schemes :  the list was so long because he had counted every programme over 1m ,  whereas schemes had previously had to cost over 5m in order to qualify .  At present ,  a minister who abuses statistics in this way has only to fear the counter - assertions of the Opposition ,  no less self - interested .  One	argument	to which the Government has no right to resort is that statistics do not matter . It is obvious that good economic indicators no more ensure good economic management than accurate instruments on the dashboard of a car ensure safe driving .  But since ministers ,  including the Prime Minister ,  are so fond of using statistics for the purposes of debate ,  they cannot be allowed to make the contradictory claim that these figures are irrelevant .	None
153	argument	2	Economic difficulties are foreclosing on Mr Lawson at an awkward moment for the Government .  The rumours which upset markets yesterday of a renewed difference of opinion between the Downing Street neighbours appear this time to be without substance .  But exchange rate troubles draw attention to the unresolved	argument	between Mrs Thatcher and her Chancellor ( backed by Sir Geoffrey Howe ) about subjecting the pound to the formal discipline of the European Monetary System . The Bundesbank has made mock of Mrs Thatcher 's  when the time is right position .  This arcane dispute contributes to the electorally damaging impression that the Prime Minister is willing to hammer the country on the anvil of her dogmatism .	None
154	argument	4	Now I am by nature an enthusiast .  I 've no idea whether Europe is going to work ,  no one has ,  and I can think of huge historical reasons why it wo n't .  But I know this ; if it is going to work , there is no	argument	that denies Britain a place at the leading edge of what is happening . Obviously ,  by background and experience I 'm wholly committed to the benefits of the capitalist system .  But I 'm a Tory .	None
155	argument	5	About a third of those interviewed said they had run away because of problems at home .  A similar number ran away after being placed in local authority care. Many spoke of being unable to get on with parents , often a step - parent , leading to constant	arguments	or violence . Ninety - eight  ( 18 per cent )  said they had been sexually abused at some time ,  including 82 girls  the victims of rape ,  incest ,  sexual assault or prostitution .  Seventeen girls said they were sexually abused by more than one person .	None
156	argument	4	The important thing is that the Thirty Year Rule is in force and that we can respond to developing perceptions of our times .  Earlier this year ,  in my capacity as chairman of the Thirties Society ,  I asked Caithness 's  successor ,  Virginia Bottomley ,  to reconsider English Heritage 's  recommendation of Bankside for listing .  My	argument	was that , as Michael Heseltine had so boldly listed Battersea Power Station in 1980 , it was illogical not to protect a much finer and more complete industrial work by the same architect . Furthermore ,  the listing of Battersea had ensured the building 's  survival for conversion to a new use  in that case ,  as an entertainment centre which the Prime Minister herself had praised and inaugurated .  After two months '  silence ,  I was informed that ministers stood by their decision .	None
157	argument	0	Accordingly ,  he has argued ,  it should be of concern only to those involved in the respective private sector transactions .  If only the markets and the media would get over their obsession with the current account numbers then the Government too could forget about them .  This	argument	derives from an idea with a distinguished academic pedigree . The reasoning is simple .  If a country has a current account deficit ,  then collectively it is spending more on things produced abroad than it is earning from abroad .	None
158	argument	4	After all ,  in every other aspect of economic behaviour we now espouse a liberal philosophy .  Why not in this aspect also   The main problem with this	argument	is the consequence of a current account deficit for the exchange rate . Take Britain 's  case with a deficit running at about 20bn a year .  This will mean 20bn - worth of sterling coming on to the market to buy foreign currency .	None
159	argument	4	If much of this information disappears after 1992  ( with the demise of customs barriers )  ,  the problem to which it relates will not. The suggestion that it will is like the idea that we can deal with inflation by ceasing to collect data on the price level .  The Chancellor should be wary of the	argument	that the deficit does not matter because it is in the private sector . Given his concern with the exchange rate ,  the argument does not stand up to analysis .  The truth of the matter is that the current account deficit is a touchstone for the success of the Thatcher revolution .	None
160	argument	2	From JOHN LICHFIELD in Washington THE FLORIDA state legislature began a special session yesterday devoted entirely to abortion law. Earlier this week , the first television debate in a fascinating and closely - fought Virginia gubernatorial race was dominated by the	arguments	for a woman 's right to choose and a foetus 's right to life . When the Supreme Court decided in July to weaken the nationwide constitutional right to abortion granted in 1973 ,  political pundits predicted a flurry of abortion - restricting legislation and political blood - letting at state level .  They also predicted abortion would overwhelm all other issues in a series of gubernatorial elections this autumn and in the state legislative and US Congressional elections next year .	None
161	argument	2	CHINA increased its patrols along the border with Hong Kong yesterday in an apparent effort to prevent an exodus of its people into the colony following a dispute over immigration procedures .  The dispute was triggered by Hong Kong 's  decision to allow the top Chinese swimmer ,  Yang Yang ,  who had sought political asylum in the West ,  to travel to the US last week .  However , the dispute reflects more the growing mistrust between the two sides rather than an	argument	over visas and numbers . Hong Kong officials said negotiations with China to end the dispute were continuing and that the colony 's  border guards were in a state of high alert in preparation for a possible influx .  Police sources said China had doubled its patrol on the border .	None
162	argument	4	Mr Scrivener said :  This court has no power to order repayment of ultra vires expenditure ,  and he commented on the presence of bank representatives ,  saying :  I have difficulty with them being here .  If the banks wanted to seek relief ,  they would have to do so through a separate case brought against the local authority ,  he added .  Although the banks will begin to present their	arguments	today , Mr Scrivener said : This court is not concerned with private rights . There is no justiciable issue between the auditor and the banks .  The two judges ,  Lord Justice Woolf and Mr Justice French ,  widened the scope of the hearing by ruling that arguments about the enforceability of the transactions could be presented .	None
163	argument	4	This followed a private hearing before Mr Justice Konrad Schiemann in London .  It is alleged that the flock is infected with Salmonella typhimurium .  The judicial review hearing will take place on Friday in the High Court when the full	arguments	will be presented , according to Dennis Cooper , who is representing the nuns . In a written application for the review ,  lawyers said the decision to slaughter was made despite a significant lack of evidence of a connection between the food poisoning outbreak in Bedworth and the monastery .  Ministry officials were also accused of giving conflicting evidence ,  leaving doubt as to the accuracy and reliability of reports of infection .	None
164	argument	2	We would be forced to invent more and more mechanisms to avoid the realignments which members of the ERM are bound to face .  In the long - term ,  this may be more damaging than a short - term run on the pound .  Predictable is the reference to our non - membership being the result of narrow - minded nationalism , and this emotive point somewhat detracts from the overall objectivity of many who put forward cogent	arguments	for British membership of the ERM . In this context ,  although Mr Lawson supports the ERM ,  he too would be ,  no doubt ,  a narrow - minded nationalist when faced with the prospect of European Monetary Union ,  as would increasing numbers of German economists who argue on the basis of economic research that EMU is not necessarily an attractive option .  It is a tragic fact that the European debate ,  which is the most complex and important issue facing the countries of this continent ,  should be treated in such a facile manner ,  with the Trojan horse of nationalism and sovereignty wheeled out every time better arguments do not prevail .

Letter :  South - east shambles	None
166	argument	2	If this is allowed to continue it means the destruction of the British egg industry ,  according to United Kingdom Egg Producers '  Association ,  which represents around 80 per cent of producers .  The nuns from the Our Lady of Passion Monastery at Daventry are seeking to block an order to slaughter one of their flocks ,  which is allegedly infected with Salmonella typhimurium .  The fundamental issue behind the	arguments	that will be heard is that the nuns are not permitted to see the results of the Ministry of Agriculture tests confirming the presence of infection . There is no right of appeal within the law. Under the Testing of Poultry Order 1989 ,  egg producers must test birds who are 18 weeks or older once every two months .	None
167	argument	2	A nation ,  wrote Burke ,  is a partnership between the past ,  the present and the future .  So let there be no doubt .  Just as there is an overwhelming moral	argument	for prudent management of the environment .

168	argument	2	Faced with a demand that could no longer be met ,  the Moscow city fathers 10 days ago limited purchases to one item per person .  But the queues continue  symbolising a gathering flight from money amid constant rumours that a currency reform is in the offing .  This would be aimed , the	argument	runs , at confiscating the ill - gotten gains of speculators in the much - hated co - operative movement , and at eliminating a surplus currency overhang of up to 150bn roubles ( 150bn ) . As must any government in similar circumstances ,  Moscow denies any such intention .  I can say firmly and unambiguously no ,   ' declared Leonid Abalkin ,  the Deputy Prime Minister in charge of economic reforms ,  when questioned on the subject by the government newspaper Izvestia .	None
169	argument	4	Yet the disappointed applicant had an unfettered right to extend the period of disruption by appealing .  Improvements in the handling of appeals The year had seen two separate and different initiatives .  The first was announced in a Practice Direction ( 1989 ) 1 WLR 281 , which provided for the much earlier delivery of skeleton	arguments	which would be studied by the judges before they sat to hear the appeal . The primary purpose was to reduce the costly time spent on oral argument in so far as that was not necessary for the proper determination fo the appeal .  It was too early to reach firm conclusions as to the direction 's  effectiveness .	None
170	argument	4	But the likelihood is that bad arguments will dominate the discussions .  On all known form ,  campaigners ,  opinion - formers and politicians themselves will engage in polarising rhetoric rather than genuine debate ,  particularly since amendments by pro - life campaigners will seek to yoke the issue of abortion to the question of embryo experimentation .  What a beneficial change it would be if instead it was acknowledged that these issues present tragic choices between compelling	arguments	which are held on both sides in good faith . There are five bad lines of approach which should be banished from the debate  and from all discussions of law and morals .  The first line of attack is often name - calling :  You would say that ,  would n't you ,  because you 're a Catholic/a man/fertile/infertile/a doctor/a research scientist .	None

173	argument	2	In what is heralded as a vote of conscience ,  any conscience ought to be deeply troubled by the agonising choice between respecting human embryos from their earliest moments and responding to the plight of infertile couples .  The issue represents the ultimate test  and perhaps the convergence  of two opposing moral theories .  Recognition of that and an agreement to forego the linguistic tricks and the cheap jibes would help convince all sides that their	arguments	have been listened to with respect . It would also help convince them that politicians have decided not on the basis of the best orchestrated campaign but by seeking to occupy the high moral ground ,  wherever it might be found .  Law :  A bad system for tackling hackers :  Proposals to curb computer crime may have the opposite effect ,  argues Mary Fagan	None
174	argument	4	Nicholas Ridley added to the general glee by saying the Government was in favour of legislation .  But few believe the findings of the Law Commission ,  or government action ,  will prevent either hacking or computer - related crime .  Indeed , there is a strong	argument	that stretching the long arm of the law to the innocent hacker could escalate rather than curb serious crime . Emma Nicholson 's  Private Member 's  Bill against hackers ,  which failed to make the grade in the last session of Parliament ,  required anyone who entered a computer to his or anyone else 's  advantage ,  or to another 's  prejudice ,  to be charged with a serious offence ,  with a maximum penalty of 10 years .  The Law Commission has been much more exact in specifying intent to commit serious crime as a necessary ingredient for one of the two more serious offences it proposes .	None

176	argument	2	But this ignores the effect of new accounting rules set out in SSAP 24 ,  which require companies to spread a surplus over a number of years .  DRG has spread the surplus over 8.5 years ,  which is long enough to justify valuing it as part of the overall earnings stream .  DRG 's property assets have also given rise to	argument	. Mr Franklin says the promised stream of profits averaging 10m over the next five years has a present value of roughly 44m .  He says he is prepared to be proved wrong  suggesting he would raise his offer if DRG produced a higher valuation .	None
177	argument	4	I went into the bedroom where Alison was lying down in what seemed to be a state of shock .  I was about to call a doctor and then ,  suddenly ,  I had a feeling which I can only describe as  excuse me  ecstatic .  I felt that the world and everything in it was benign , that Alison was infinitely precious and that Dummett 's	argument	from value that we know there is right and wrong to a transcendent being was certainly sound . I said all this to Alison ,  and I 've been saying it to her ever since ,  and ,  back in London ,  I 've been saying it to anyone else who 'll listen .  On Wednesday I met Mrs Matthews in the street and she asked if I 'd taken the cat to the vet and I admitted that I had n't .	None
178	argument	2	The Blackpool meeting was the first between Mr Savimbi and a British minister ,  underlining the importance Britain attaches to persuading Mr Savimbi to return to the conference table .  The Unita leader indicated that he was ready to do so ,  and suggested a meeting in Libreville within the next month .  Mr Savimbi is meeting President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire in Paris on Monday , and yesterday the Angolan Foreign Minister , Pedro de Castro van Dunem , hurried there to put his side of the	argument	to the Zairean mediator . Officials say it is because the two sides have different versions of what was decided at the previous negotiations that the ceasefire has broken down. Angola wants Mr Savimbi to go into voluntary exile while elections are held ,  perhaps to return later ,  but his supporters say there was no such agreement .	None
179	argument	4	FERRARI yesterday decided to drop its appeals against the 32,000 fine and ban imposed on Nigel Mansell following his failure to stop after being disqualified from the Portuguese Grand Prix ,  writes Maurice Hamilton .  The Portuguese authorities had promised to hear Ferrari 's  appeal against the fine next Wednesday ,  after which the FIA ,  the international automobile federation ,  was due to reach a decision on Ferrari 's  appeal over Mansell 's  ban from the Spanish Grand Prix which was staged on 1 October .  Ferrari , while still convinced their	arguments	against the sanctions were valid , but mindful of the tradition they represent , said they wished to remove any disturbing elements from Formula One racing during the final two races of the season in Japan and Australia . Apart from clearing Mansell 's  name if they upheld the appeal ,  the FIA tribunal would be of little further use to either the Englishman or his team .  The FIA said last week that the results of the Spanish Grand Prix would remain ,  regardless of the outcome of any appeal .	None
180	argument	4	This is true irrespective of the level of violence ,  although the masculine occupational culture of the force contains many of the same sanitizing euphemisms for violence against women  ( giving the wife a diggin '  .  In the one instance of domestic violence we encountered during field - work ,  the officers arrested the man against the protestations of the wife ,  as is often the case  ( see Fielding et al  .  1988 ) , despite Faragher 's	argument	, although primarily in our case because the man redirected his attack towards the police . There are also big crime calls ,  which refer to the real job of crime - fighting ,  which the section police enjoy most .  During the period of field - work the sorts of crime that occurred in Easton under this heading included murder and major robbery ,  possession of drugs ,  breaking and entering ,  car chases for stolen vehicles ,  and the occasional sex - related crime .

181	argument	4	1988 :  22737 )  .  More recently this consensus has been attributed to similar patterns of socialization into the canteen culture of the police  ( for example ,  Brogden et al  .  1987 ; Reiner 1985 ; for an earlier and related	argument	see van Maanen 1973 , 1975 ) , and thus to the existence of a generalized police occupational culture . But it is not only typical patterns of informal on - the - job training which are important ,  for there is also a congruence in aspects of formal police training  ( on both aspects of training see Fielding 1984 ,  1988a ,  b )  .  The ubiquity of these notions also reflects that the labour process itself influences policemen and women in how they view their work ,  and the sociology of policing has shown how routine policing consists of similar tasks wherever it occurs .	None
182	argument	4	A third effect which could be added is that business experience would be gained by the local merchant ,  and thus the society begins to develop a pool of people with such business experience .  Experience of this nature may reduce the reliance of less developed countries on goods imported from abroad ;  local manufacturers may be able to satisfy local market needs by intelligent marketing ,  and thus gain a larger share of the local market than before ,  with consequent results for local levels of production and the economy generally .  A further element in this	argument	is the possibility that advertising can be used as part of a marketing strategy to shape the wants and needs of a less developed society in a direction that is clearly beneficial . For instance ,  if a country concerned still employs traditional systems which ,  in the light of more modern techniques ,  appear to be detrimental to public health ,  it may be desirable to change patterns of behaviour in ,  say ,  nutrition or hygiene .  Often this will not be successful if the population is attached to its traditional methods and the new methods are radically different from the old ;  a careful marketing campaign to change attitudes can have a dramatic effect ,  particularly by presenting new products in a way that is not dramatically different from the old .

183	argument	4	Any diminution of freedom reduces the quality of life .  There may be compensations for a loss of freedom but there are no substitutes for it .  On the other hand ,	arguments	that freedom is valuable for something other than itself are seldom convincing . Usually they are a mixture of wishful thinking and libertarian special pIeading .  As far as British news media are concerned ,  freedom simply does not perform the tasks that Mill 's  followers hoped it would .	None
184	argument	4	That approach ,  which gives two - thirds of news coverage to the incumbent government ,  is reasonable ,  even generous ,  if viewed in the context of the Mobilizing Ideal which accords priority to established authority .  Equally ,  it is unreasonable ,  even unacceptable ,  in the context of other ideals for the relationship between the media and society .  Harrison and others defend the present system with another	argument	. They agree that the government gets extra television  coverage but argue that such coverage is not necessarily favourable .  In 1987 perhaps the Prime Minister 's  pre - election visit to Moscow and her eve - of - election trip to the Venice summit of Western leaders were favourable to her re - election ,  but Harold Wilson always asserted that a bad set of trade figures a few days before polling cost him an election ,  while the effect of being centre - stage during the Iran hostages affair may have been devastating to Jimmy Carter 's  fortunes .

185	argument	3	The book ends with a conclusion which points to his aforementioned radical solution .  Scorn will heaped on the book by people who cannot think of the countryside as anything other than a marketable resource ,  or those who think they are being environmentally perceptive because they call a gate a  peripherial  access point and a path a mountain access route .  Nevertheless , Crumley 's is a starkly presented	argument	which should be read and studied alongside the barrage of soulless technical documentation already written on this emotive subject .

186	argument	5	On balance ,  it was his wish to defend sterling by interventionist methods ,  to check activity at home and keep down the sterling price of imports ,  rather than curb the flow of money ,  that dictated much of his policy .  But what kind of post - monetarism he was espousing was uncertain ,  too .  This uncertainty was reflected in unprecedented levels of	argument	within the government , conducted in the full glare of public attention . The Prime Minister came close to accusing the Chancellor of starting the inflationary spiral by an attempt to link the rate for sterling with the value of the German deutschmark .  Nigel Lawson rebutted this with some vigour .	None
187	argument	2	The revival of the campaign for Scottish devolution  indeed ,  for Scottish nationalism ,  as shown in Jim Sillars '  by - election victory in Govan  was a notable feature of the later phase of Mrs Thatcher 's  regime .  Here and elsewhere ,  the government strove to identify itself with new themes .  In particular , the green	argument	advanced by environmentalists , fanned by the importance of themes such as land conservation , acid rain , and the protection of the ozone layer and the greenhouse effect in the 1989 Euro - elections , suggested that the message of Thatcherite consumption and wealth creation failed to mesh with wider concerns for the quality of life . The rise of green issues ,  indeed ,  was more naturally appealing to Labour or Alliance politicians ,  and a powerful reminder of the rich variety of resistance to Thatcherism that British society could release .  It led to Nicholas Ridley 's  removal from the Environment department in July 1989 ,  in favour of the notoriously wet Chris Patten .	None
188	argument	4	Therefore the little Ramsey ,  when he arrived at Repton in 1918 ,  met a headmaster destined to play a far more important part in his life than is the fate of most headmasters .  Fisher was quick ,  affable ,  capable .  He always saw straight to the point of an	argument	. He could remember  who everyone was .  He could be a severe disciplinarian but he was not a rigid man.	None
189	argument	2	He had to recite from memory in front of his headmaster fifty Greek lines from the play Medea   a severe punishment ,  for learning fifty lines of verse in a language imperfectly known would take several hours of spare time .  The severity may have had a cause hidden from the young Ramsey .  just before he arrived at the school Victor Gollancz left its staff , ejected because he tried to rouse boys ' minds by heady and daring political	argument	. In a war for the nation 's  life this was held by external authorities to be provocative .  The Gollancz scandal ,  as the blimps thought of it ,  was widely known .	None
190	argument	4	The younger said that religious experience was too valid to be dismissed by mere reason ,  that reason was not all of humanity .  The argument went on and on .  The elder was contemptuous when the younger replied to his crushing	arguments	by the reply , the reason why you think like that is that you do n't say your prayers . Michael 's  problem was that he saw the glamour in Frank 's  position :  the love of liberty ;  the excitement in the free pursuit of truth ;  the shaking off of convention and mere conformity ;  the feeling that religion was a stuffy valley out of which he had grown .  He also had to recognize that his brother was an unselfish person ;  so that the axiom ,  only religious people are unselfish did not wash .	None
191	argument	5	Michael 's  problem was that he saw the glamour in Frank 's  position :  the love of liberty ;  the excitement in the free pursuit of truth ;  the shaking off of convention and mere conformity ;  the feeling that religion was a stuffy valley out of which he had grown .  He also had to recognize that his brother was an unselfish person ;  so that the axiom ,  only religious people are unselfish did not wash .  The	argument	was a fire in which to test an immature faith . A school prize was offered for a study of the book Belief in God  by Bishop Charles Gore .  When Frank heard that Michael thought of going in for the prize on this set book he was indignant and sent a message to Michael ,  Who in his senses would read a book by a bishop 	None
192	argument	2	Nor did he find it awkward that the tutor 's  rooms were immediately below his own in the Pepys building .  Evidently he did not expect to give riotous or alcoholic parties at times when the tutor might be in .  The undergraduates found him a leg - puller , and a reveller in political	argument	. The chaplain of the college was a pleasant gentleman ,  his teacher of classics was a worthy pedant ,  and neither meant much to him. The person who meant a lot to him was the Master .	None
193	argument	5	He  dedicated this formidable intellect to eradicating nonsense from the world ,  especially nonsense in divinity ,  which was a world where in those days he could find plenty of targets for his scorn .  And in the faculty he was surrounded by several men of substance with much the same opinions though with less hardness in their advocacy .  Since most Christian teachers are kind persons who prefer to avoid controversy when they can , and doodle anxiously during fierce	argument	at meetings , things tended to go the way of Bethune - Baker ; partly because he was devastating , and partly because often he was devastatingly right . To be of Anglo - Catholic opinions in this group was to be a man apart .  Bethune - Baker regarded Anglo - Catholicism as part of the nonsense which it was his mission to destroy .	None
194	argument	5	When he got exhausted from parish work ,  and felt unwell ,  a fear would darken him ,  that the demon ,  seemingly exorcized ,  might return .  And already he knew in his heart that to be a vicar or a curate was not his vocation as a priest for the rest of his life .   While this internal	argument	reached its height , his superiors argued about him without his knowledge . From opposite ends of England the academics said that this was a born teacher who ought to be in teaching as soon as possible .  Raven said it in Liverpool .	None
195	argument	2	Here was an Anglo - Catholic who insisted on the apostolic succession of bishops ,  and thought intercommunion between the Churches ,  before a proper union ,  to be wrong ,  and yet refused to unchurch the Protestant Churches .  Rome refused to take any part in these proceedings ,  except by unofficial observers .  Therefore a man like Ramsey brought the	argument	about Christian unity up against the fundamental question of Catholicity versus Protestantism in a way which few others could . The Protestant leaders found him far too rigid .  But he was curiously persuasive .	None
196	argument	5	This was a Churchill decaying physically ,  slower in the uptake ,  less able to work long hours ,  less interested in the peacetime problems of the country ,  but still well enough to make his own decisions .  He had an archbishop ,  Fisher ,  with a good judgement of men and with a lot of information about them .  So the discussion , and the	argument	, began to develop not so much between prime minister and archbishop , as between archbishop and Churchill 's patronage secretary Anthony Bevir . For the first time a civil servant ,  perforce ,  began to affect what happened .  The see of Durham was the fourth senior see in the Church .	None
197	argument	2	If Bell is ruled out as too old and Ramsey as too new ,  who else has stature   George Chase of Ripon ,  good as gold and wise as Solomon ,  but even shyer than Ramsey and without his intellectual bite   Two other circumstances entered this prolonged	argument	. These were hardly mentioned but underneath were not trivial .  First ,  the York diocese had no desire for George Bell and every desire for Ramsey .	None
198	argument	4	Some of these canons were still observed  ( what to wear when conducting morning prayer )  and some were long obsolete  ( rules about clergy nightcaps or yellow stockings on their legs )  .  It therefore occurred to the canon lawyers  a rarefied group of experts  that Church law ,  framed by the Church organs and then approved by the sovereign ,  could achieve the canons which would bind consciences .  Archbishop Fisher accepted the	argument	and became the enthusiastic leader of the new movement . The work was hard ;  hard to frame ,  hard to get through committees ,  hard to get accepted .  No archbishop but Fisher would have had the administrative ability or the tenacity to achieve the end .	None
199	argument	2	If one is partly responsible already for the general policy of a Church or for anything else ,  it is better to be more responsible .  It puzzled him into the New Year of 1961 that no one asked his opinion .  Five years before , Fisher drew him into the	argument	. This silence was marked .  He assumed that this could only be because he was one of the possibles .	None
200	argument	4	Macmillan talked to Sir Henry Willink ,  the Master of Magdalene .  Perhaps the prime minister expected that Willink would push for a Magdalene man but he did not get a firm line out of him. Willink as a lawyer had a lot to do with the administration of the Church and saw the	argument	that an archbishop must be able to bear a load of administration . Macmillan consulted the Queen ,  who knew and liked both Ramsey and Coggan .  He also took the trouble to buy and read a new book of theology which Ramsey at that moment published ;  an account of the development of English religious thought from the late Victorian age to the age of William Temple  From Gore to Temple  .	None
201	argument	2	The Roman poet says ,   dutce est desipere in loco  ,  an opportunity for indiscretion is sometimes pleasant .  If the doctrine of collective responsibility can never quite be forgotten or discarded ,  at least it weighs most lightly on the wearer in the bracing ,  not to say rarefied ,  intellectual atmosphere of the CPC .  Therefore I do not see why tonight I might not occasionally , if the	argument	should lead that way , be guilty of saying in office some of the things which I have said out of office . The Plowden Report on Control of Public Expenditure  contained ,  amongst other nuggets of wisdom ,  the following sentence which I should like to take as my starting - point :  The social changes of the last fifteen years have altered the incidence of hardship ,  so that there now may well be excessive social services for some purposes and inadequate ones for others .  I should have thought that ,  in the abstract ,  no one was likely to quarrel with that statement .	None
202	argument	2	Otherwise ,  one wonders ,  how could there constantly be those asides ,  which seem to reveal that the participants were actually aware the game was up or rather perhaps had never started   One of the lessons to be drawn from the study of early - twentieth - century imperialism is the extraordinary durability of policies and programmes which lack all possibility of being realised .  The remarkable thing about political houses built on sand , or castles in the air , is how long they often take to collapse ; and this very time - lag becomes an	argument	in their favour and a supposed refutation of those who draw attention to the absence of foundations . There must be a foundation somewhere ,  says the populace ;  for look ,  the building continues to stand up. There is yet one further stage of insight  and of pessimism  which awaits the student .	None
203	argument	4	In front of a consequence so stark the deepest political thinkers recoiled .  In the noble eloquence of his plea for conciliation with the colonists ,  Burke ,  who based his case on the proposition that they had not been represented at Westminster ,  drew a strange and illogical conclusion .  His own	argument	involved the admission that no common government , no common state , comprising both Great Britain and the colonies could subsist . Yet he proceeded to declare that by refraining from exercising in America the power of the executive which it controlled in Great Britain ,  Parliament would preserve the unity of the Empire :  The more ardently they love liberty ,  the more perfect will be their obedience .	None
204	argument	5	Tape every rehearsal on a portastudio or cassette machine ,  and distribute copies of the tape amongst the band well in advance of the next rehearsal .  This gives each musician time to practise so that you all arrive at the rehearsal ready to try out new ,  revised musical parts .  Taping rehearsals also reduces the likelihood of	arguments	about who played what at the last rehearsal . If you need someone to do the taping ,  either make it one musician 's  responsibility ,  or try to find    someone who would like to mix your sound at gigs .  At this stage you do n't need an experienced sound engineer .	None
205	argument	4	They must always be risked .  Clues ,  however remote ,  may be crucial .  The	argument	for preserving Shakespeare 's laundry bills is that , eventually , they may find their Sherlock Holmes . The reader should bear in mind Eliot 's  exasperation at the graduate student who identifies Corbire 's  Rhapsode Foraine as an exploration of folk - religion .  Nevertheless ,  in the early twenties Eliot 's  mind was clearly full of not only Frazer	None
206	argument	3	He relates this to the state of culture of his own age ,  facing dangers of over - specialization ,  which impoverishes both the religious and artistic sensibilities by separating each from the other ,  so that only the vestige of manners  may be left for those who ,  having their sensibility uninformed either by religion or by art ,  have nothing left but an inherited behaviour which ceases to have meaning .  Eliot had written of and against such a milieu  when he combined the elements of the savage and the city ,  from the beating tom - tom of Portrait of a Lady through the rituals of The Waste Land  and Sweeney Agonistes  to the cocktail chatter and jungle martyrdom of the play ,  The Cocktail Party  ,  yet to come .  Revising the original articles for Notes towards the Definition of Culture , he complicated his	argument	's texture by involving more material relevant to his personal history and to the history of his work , such as that mention of Heart of Darkness which looks back to The Waste Land . The first article in the series which became the book demonstrated that Eliot 's  definition of culture begins with the savage .  The second showed that at the other pole is the city .	None
207	argument	4	I have in mind two  especially :  the first involves what might be called the impossibility of desire ,  the second the notion of desire and/or identity as involving an ineluctable splitting .  Like other key notions in psychoanalysis ,  the sense of desire as a quest for an always impossible self - completion in or through the other has a long though oft en unrecognized history .  In this case Kaja Silverman has usefully remarked the importance , for Jacques Lacan 's version of this	argument	, of Aristophanes ' conception of the person as an original androgynous whole ( in Plato 's Symposium ) . The human subject is conceived in terms of an essential ,  intrinsic lack ;  it is a fragment of something larger and more primordial ,  whose existence is dominated by the desire to recover its missing complement  (  The Subject of Semiotics  ,  152 )  .  But the complement remains forever out of reach and desire thereby becomes ,  for Lacan ,  a kind of derangement ,  with the subject caught in the rails  eternally stretching forth towards the desire for something else   of metonymy  (  ' crits  ,  167 )  .	None
208	argument	4	In The Masculine Dilemma   ( 1980 )  ,  subtitled A Psychology of Masculinity ,  Gregory Rochlin offers a different version of the homosexual male ,  but one which is once again in the service of defending an updated heterosexual masculinity ,  and its primacy within a sexual difference metaphysic .  Drawing on psychoanalysis ,  Rochlin rewrites masculinity in a way which makes a virtue of what was hitherto thought of as ,  or experienced as ,  a defect :  its much remarked insecurity .  His	argument	is as follows : a man 's masculinity is indeed insecure ; it is an endless trial , a precariously held , endlessly tested , unstable condition ( p. 91 ) . In this it is almost tragic :  the unique vulnerability to tailed expectations is the fatal flaw in the masculine ego the testing of masculinity knows no bounds to prove oneself remains a lifelong necessity .  It gives rise to many of man 's  anxieties and failures as well as to his often extraordinary achievements  ( pp. x ,  xi )  .	None
209	argument	4	The metaphysical construction of subjectivity is at once an admission and production of its disruptive potential ,  a disruption in and of the very terms of its construction .  It also suggests ,  paradoxically ,   that the less autonomous individuality is thought to be ,  the more it might be marked by a potentially subversive agency .  But this is to anticipate the	argument	; for the moment I want only to observe that a conception of the self as socially and/or metaphysically constituted produces one idea of transgression , and that of the self as ideally ( if not actually ) unified and autonomous , quite another .

210	argument	5	In a letter of 25 January 1620 Sir John Chamberlain remarks a very significant event in the contemporary cross - dressing controversy :  James I 's  instruction to the clergy to suppress women doing it .  The king is reported as having told the clergy that they must reproach the practice vehemently and bitterly ,  and if this did not succeed ,  he would take further measures .  Chamberlain refers to this in the same breath as mentioning an	argument	between the Marquess Buckingham and Hamilton over the selling of honours and abasing ancient nobility , by new advancements .

212	argument	4	But these largely managerial changes hardly amounted to a fundamental review ;  rather they were concerned to promote competition and value for money .  Over time the rhetoric of government spokesmen has changed to boasting of how much more manpower  ( doctors and nurses )  and money is devoted to the NHS ,  compared to 1979 .  The government 's early	arguments	that we ca n't afford it are less persuasive with the budget surplus accumulated in 1987 and 1988 and claims that tax cuts are better than greater state spending on social and health services have found fewer takers among the public ( see below p. 297 ) . Privatization The impact of the Thatcher government 's  new thinking has most obviously been felt in the privatization programme for the state - owned and state - provided services .	None
213	argument	2	On the one hand ,  a private sector which allowed free entry of producers ,  was subject to competition ,  sought profits ,  and had to respond to consumers or else go bankrupt .  On the other side was the public sector ,  enjoying a monopolistic and low - risk position ,  responding to political rather than consumer preferences ,  and pre - empting investment funds from more productive areas .  Since 1979 the programme of privatization has been defended with a mixture of ideological and pragmatic	arguments	. One is that such policies produce an extension of economic freedom and ,  thereby ,  political freedom .  The nationalized industries ,  it is claimed ,  deprive the consumer of choice and limit the taxpayer 's  freedom to spend his money as he chooses because of the industry 's  monopoly position and reliance on state subsidies .	None
214	argument	2	In public and private she is a relentless educator .  An important task of leadership ,  in her view ,  is to win the battle of ideas ,  and this is done by frequently expressing basic beliefs and principles .  She seems to revel in	arguments	and loses no opportunity to declare her political principles . Initially Shadow Cabinet colleagues were worried by her view of politics as an ideological battle ground and by her disavowal of many cross bench attitudes  ( Chapter 1 )  .  They feared that she would be seen as  ( indeed is  )  abrasive and lacking compassion .	None

Her frequent denunciations of high levels of taxation and public expenditure ,  of big government ,  and of the diminution of individual freedom and choice are passionate and deeply felt ;  they are expressed in attacks on the baneful ,  almost immoral ,  effects of inflation and of governments which debase the currency ,  or borrow rather than balance their income and expenditure .   For all the pejorative talk of her being an ideologue ,  however ,  she is a practical Conservative .	None
216	argument	5	Mrs Thatcher has a clear view of her role as Prime Minister and sees herself as an activist rather than an arbitrator in Cabinet disputes or a spokesman for a collective Cabinet view .  There is a great difference between the Attlee concept and Thatcher 's  robust assertion of 1979 :  It must be a conviction government .  As Prime Minister I could not waste time having any internal	arguments	or Yes , I do drive through things which I believe in passionately what else do you expect of a Prime Minister  I 'm not here just to be Chairman ,  I 'm here because I believe in things .

217	argument	2	The so - called wets favoured an interventionist role for government in the economy and were prepared to increase state spending to boost employment ,  even if this risked some increase in inflation .  But over time the Conservative party divisions on economic policy became less marked ,  partly because of electoral success and partly because unemployment has fallen steadily from June 1986 .  It could fairly be said that Mrs Thatcher won the economic	argument	. The simple division between dry and wet does not ,  however ,  do justice to the currents of opinion in the contemporary Conservative party .  One of the effects of the Thatcher decade has been to redefine the benchmark of divisions .	None
218	argument	2	Whatever the fate of the Thatcher government ,  the New Right will survive it .  In its impact on British politics and economic policy it has already been remarkably successful .  The traditional post - war	argument	between different kinds of interventionism has been replaced by a much broader debate . The 1983 and 1987 Gallup election surveys showed that voters across all parties agreed on many goals of government .  This is significant ,  given that many commentators in 1983 thought that the policies of the Conservative and Labour parties were further apart than at any time over the previous thirty years .	None
219	argument	4	Instead of being asked ,  as he must have hoped ,  whether he would be willing to form a government ,  he was instead asked whether he would be prepared to serve in a National Government under MacDonald .  This was a question to which ,  for a patriotic Conservative leader ,  there could be only one answer .  The King 's actions in August 1931 are sometimes defended with the	argument	that he was merely acting on the advice of the party leaders . But the course of these interviews shows that no party leader was unequivocally in favour of a National Government led by MacDonald ,  in the event of the Labour government collapsing .  MacDonald said that he might be of no further use ,   should resign with the whole Cabinet ;  the night before his interview with the King ,  Baldwin had gone to Neville Chamberlain 's  house in Eaton Square ,  and hoped and prayed that he might not have to join a National Government ;  even after his interview with the King .	None
220	argument	4	On 3 October the King told the Prime Minister that he must at all costs find the solution himself ,  and His Majesty would refuse to accept his resignation .  He must be more patient and brace himself up to realise that he was the only person who could tackle the present chaotic state of affairs ,  ' This was the fourth time the King had told MacDonald that he would not accept his resignation .   There were certainly strong	arguments	in favour of the course which the King adopted . It was clear that the dominant element in his government ,  that is ,  the Conservatives ,  were determined upon an election .  Moreover ,  MacDonald was in principle in favour of an election ,  but unable to secure agreement upon a formula which could reconcile protectionists and free traders up to the very last moment .	None
221	argument	4	He did not do so .  Indeed ,  he put pressure on Sir Herbert Samuel to abandon its terms .  Despite the	arguments	in favour of the course which the King adopted , his encouragement to MacDonald to hold the government together and to fight the election as a government had quite momentous consequences for the politics of the 1930s . Although the King 's  intentions were not partisan ,  the consequences were such as to offer very considerable benefit to the Conservative party .  The 1931 general election gave the Conservatives a huge overall majority in the House of Commons ,  enabling them to pursue their tariff policy with little hindrance .	None

Orlando Azcu and two others were taken to Kilo 7 Maximum Security Prison in Camaguey where ,  on 17 January ,  they went on hunger - strike .  They were said to have been forcibly dressed in the prison uniform and held for at least 17 days with their	arms	chained to the cell bars to prevent them from removing the uniform . Orlando Azcu was also said to have been beaten by prison guards on at least three occasions .

223	arm	4	I have very unpleasant recollections of sitting for him ,  for it was of utmost importance not to move but to fix him right in the eye and listen to him complain ,  saying as he always did that he was getting nowhere .  It was not much fun ,  particularly at my age Things would deteriorate rather quickly , for Alberto would return to his hotel in the evening with a sculpture eight to twelve inches tall under his	arm	and come back the next day with a piece no more than three or four inches high I later realized that I had posed during a crucial period ,  and the tiny bronzes that resulted  ( for that size prevailed )  continue daily to touch me .

225	arm	4	The selection is right if it truly works for the competing student ,  and it is the quality and force of the imagination that will carry off the performance of the piece .  The most important thing is your firm knowledge that the selection is within your present range .  It 's not much use arriving somewhere at ten in the morning clutching the collected works under your	arm	and wishing you had a wig and been born thirty years earlier in order to play Lear or for that matter the Duke of Gloucester . Major roles for older women are not so common in Shakespeare ,  but I think it is better not to choose a character such as Queen Katherine from Henry VIII  ,  who needs a richness of seniority to convey the dramatic interest .  If you do want to portray an older figure ,  it would be preferable to try Hermione in The Winter 's  Tale   she is a more fantastical character ,  without the added complications of historical authenticity ,  and so allows for greater flexibility of characterisation .	None
226	arm	1	It is possible for such sentiments of approval of this past to coexist with abhorrence for most current acts of violence .  But the political significance of this culture is that where opinion counts and where the catholic  nationalist remnant actually experiences the coercive power of protestant loyalists and the British army in the Northern statelet ,  there violence has all the more support .  When it does , it tends to be a reaction to perceived injustice , such as internment without trial , or the conviction of a son by a sole judge in a trial held in total secrecy and on the evidence of unseen witnesses , or a simple case of one 's house being badly mauled by careless soldiers searching for	arms	. This reactive violence is thus justified by its subjects and the justification subsists  in consciousness along with their Roman catholic profession of faith and identity .  The provisional IRA 's  commitment to violence against the British and against the protestant  loyalist alliance ,  which the provisionals rhetorically and conveniently subsume under the term the British ,  is frequently assumed to be based on either Marxist or nationalist principles and in both cases to be secularist or areligious .

229	arm	4	From the yet more gloomy expression on his normally lugubrious face it was evident that he had resigned himself to her companionship at least as far as his hotel perched up far above the sea .  So it was without surprise that he found himself sharing with her one of the tinny ,  open - sided cars of the creaky old funicular that saved tourists the toil of climbing the seven hundred and more steep stone steps up from the Marina Grande .  As soon as the linked train of little open cars began its steeply angled ascent she clutched the Finnish detective by the	arm	. Mr Hjerson she gasped .  Did you notice 	None

235	arm	3	It is important to practise adjusting the airbrakes during the float and to kick yourself hard if you ever land short of your point with brake still applied .  It simply means that you have frozen on the airbrake lever and have undershot when you could have saved the situation .  This is the same as throttle	arm	paralysis on a powered aircraft when the pilot undershoots and crashes his aircraft . He could have pushed the throttle forwards and avoided the accident by using the engine .  It is also worthwhile attempting the occasional no airbrake touch down to get a better idea of how far your glider will float .	None
236	arm	5	Such special knowledge holds further difficulties ,  for it highlights the specifically political nature of any ethnographic account  of such an institution ,  bringing to the forefront those expectations of loyalty which the executive demands of any individual who has hold of the account .  Ethical problems will surface ,  for no power - based organization likes to have its idiosyncrasies made public ,  and the anthropologist who is a member of the family and not merely a temporary visitor to the backyard exotica can find that writing anything at all becomes crucially problematic .  Expectations of confidentiality and silence prevent many accounts from reaching fruition , for as the revelations of Spycatcher ( Wright and Greenglass 1986 ) revealed , it is not necessarily what is written which causes the pain ; rather it is the breach of the convention which requires members in various	arms	of the executive to say nothing about their practices . This returns us to Arendt 's  observation that secrecy is a prerequisite of totalitarianism ,  for those involved in the executive use of power know that to reveal is antagonistic to its maintenance .  The insider/anthropologist is therefore somewhat schizophrenic ,  something of a Jekyll and Hyde ,  for he knows that publication and explication might be career - suicidal but are necessary intellectual tasks .	None
237	arm	5	In their own research departments the police continuously attempt to measure aspects of their activity ,  largely to demonstrate cost effectiveness in line with criteria imposed by the limits on public spending  ( HO Circular 114/83 )  and the prevalent socio - economic world view of society .  This has meant that many studies tend to concentrate on the objective assessment of a fiscally quantifiable reality .  For example , the Audit Commission ( an	arm	of the treasury ) spent some time in 1987/8 with myself and others in a police research department assessing an OSU ( Operational Support Unit ) administrative system which they claimed had revolutionized police decision making and released manpower for patrol equal to 6.358 million . However ,  a colleague looking at these OSUs in relation to their cultural impact ,  saw there were many aspects of a qualitative nature which could not easily be expressed in fiscal terms  ( Adams 1988 :  11 )  :  direct submission of reports to the 0 .	None
238	arm	5	Since this condemnation of research opportunity ,  few studies have penetrated deeply beneath the sensitive skin of police culture ,  and even though Chatterton in his notes to my thesis argued there has been a considerable amount of participant police research ,  I would question whether many of these inquiries achieved the finer grain and detail ' of the insider 's  account ,  for they can never really know or tell if they have been excluded from the inner workings of police practice or prevented from gaining access to the hidden realities contained inside the heads of the constables .  Because of the litism which such an organization of control wields ,  it is not surprising there is difficulty in incorporating the outside researcher ,  or in accepting his critical findings .  And certainly that other main	arm	of executive control the army seems little better at this than the police , for the number of participant accounts of their deep structures remains negligible , supporting McCabe 's ( 1980 ) contention that we should be asking of all of these costly institutions , who is to be controlled by whom and for what reasons  Meanwhile ,  as Reiner  ( 1985 )  suggests ,  the politicization of the police has proceeded at a pace ,  and can be illustrated by their growing willingness to respond to political dissent as a form of crime or deviancy .  This trend is further displayed in their growing tendency to agree to be used as a pseudo - military arm of government in its socio - economic and industrial/political disputes with whole sections of society .

In 1985 ,  Cressida Dick ,  a probationary constable ,  wrote a prize - winning essay which clearly showed an awareness of this politicization ,  and asked the sort of questions which few senior officers seemed to be thinking or voicing .

From her ice age , she wrenched herself to turn and wrap both	arms	round Lucy 's waist , her pounding head butting against the soft silk of her blouse . Hold tight  ,  said Lucy ,  suddenly mummy .  Jay gripped ,  burrowed her head in Lucy 's  belly :  here so safe and wanted inside her beloved Jeremy had grown ;  her brow nudged Lucy 's  breasts ,  where Jeremy had sucked himself full and strong ,  where she had found a contentment warm as summer wind across white sands ;  here she had swum easy as a seal ,  crystal seas halcyon over her head .

253	arm	4	Make sure that you know what these are and what they mean .  Briefly ,  if the referee points his fingers this indicates that someone had done something wrong .  If he extends his	arms	with the fingers together it is an award . Finally ,  if the referee brings both fists together in the middle of the chest ,  this means that both contestants scored at the same time ,  so no awards will be made .  A more detailed list of Japanese expressions appear at the end of this book  ( p. 109 )  .	None
254	arm	4	Even during flurries of techniques ,  both hands remain on their respective sides of the centre - line .  Arm movement Economy of	arm	movement is important since the more you flail them about , the longer it takes to cock them for an effective punch . Move your arms as little as is necessary to achieve your purpose ,  and always move them together so that if the front hand is knocking down an incoming punch ,  the rear is executing a counter - punch .  You simply do not have the time for the one  pause  two sequences so beloved in basic training .	None
255	arm	4	Follow the opponent 's  shape ,  not his attacking limb ,  because although an individual technique may have been successfully evaded ,  the opponent still remains potentially dangerous .   Scoop the opponent 's  front kick ,  drawing it back and up to break his balance If you are likely to face his open side , then circle your blocking	arm	so you twist him away A front kick can also be countered effectively by moving back on the diagonal .  Face the opponent in opposite stance  ( i.e. if your opponent 's  right leg is forward you lead with your left and vice versa )  .	None
256	arm	4	The third example uses a short but wide diagonal movement of the front foot to take you clear of the opponent 's  incoming reverse punch .  Use a long ,  thrusting snap punch to the opponent 's  face and if the chance presents itself ,  follow up quickly with a reverse punch .  If the opponent 's attack is a face punch , then hit his extended	arm	with your forearm , glancing your punch over the top of his and into the target . ( a )  Step diagonally forwards ,  catching the opponent 's  advancing punch with your leading forearm ( b )  Continue your fist into the opponent 's  face	None
257	arm	4	The second requirement is that of good timing .  Some competitors just are n't quick enough off the mark ,  or they hold back instead of thrusting in strongly .  Either of these faults means that the attacking technique is well developed before you move into it , and so your front barring	arm	or groin suffer accordingly . Move directly into a high roundhouse kick and stop - punch it Stop a front kick by barring down with your leading guard whilst reverse - punching to the opponent 's  chest	None
258	arm	4	To do this you slide back your rear foot so that the stance lengthens  ( this makes it more stable in a longitudinal direction )  and your centre of gravity drops .  If the action is sharp enough your opponent 's  punch will graze over the top of your head ,  helped on its way by a fast rising block .  As well as dealing with the punch , the rising block travels diagonally up and forwards into the opponent , catching him high on the attacking	arm	. Do not lean forwards as you block since this will bring your chin close to the opponent 's  other fist .  There is no need to withdraw your blocking arm fully as you reverse punch ;  you probably wo n't have enough time to anyway !	None

Do not lean forwards as you block since this will bring your chin close to the opponent 's  other fist .  There is no need to withdraw your blocking	arm	fully as you reverse punch ; you probably wo n't have enough time to anyway ! The main thing is to shift your centre of gravity forwards behind the punch ,  so that it is delivered with plenty of power .  Simply rock forwards on to your leading knee to achieve this .	None
260	arm	4	shout to underline your score .  Drop under the opponent 's high punch , blocking high on his	arm	with rising block whilst reverse - punching strongly with the other MAKING YOUR PUNCH SCORE As we saw in the chapter dealing with rules ,  it is not enough for your punch to be an effective scoring technique ;  it must be seen to be so ,  and this entails making its success obvious .	None
261	arm	4	Even if the slide is not feasible ,  you can still throw your centre of gravity forward ,  so that weight increases on the leading leg .  The fifth attention - grabber is the exaggerated hip action which should accompany every punch .  This shows that the punch is not merely an	arm	movement , but a powerful , co - ordinated body action . The punching hip ,  be it the leading hip of a front punch or the trailing hip of a reverse punch ,  must swivel forwards ,  so that your centre - line directly faces the opponent .  You may well decide to twist even further when using the front punch ,  but beware that your situation is weakened should the opponent immediately counter  attack .	None
262	arm	4	The back fist This punch is not a linear strike like the previous two but a circular one .  The back fist unrolls from the shoulder , propelled as much by the body turning away as by the	arm	action itself . Many karateka get this wrong and make use only of the arm action .  A back fist will out - range a reverse punch performed by an opponent of equal height but it is not often scored because many referees do not consider it powerful enough .	None
263	arm	4	This punch is not a linear strike like the previous two but a circular one .  The back fist unrolls from the shoulder ,  propelled as much by the body turning away as by the arm action itself .  Many karateka get this wrong and make use only of the	arm	action . A back fist will out - range a reverse punch performed by an opponent of equal height but it is not often scored because many referees do not consider it powerful enough .  Nevertheless it remains an excellent opening strike because ,  even more than the snap punch ,  it cocks the hips for a powerful reverse punch .	None
264	arm	4	Lean in behind the strike in order to get the maximum range ,  and raise your other hand as a guard .  Unfortunately ,  the cocking action that begins a back fist movement presents an unmistakable cue to the opponent .  The punching elbow must be flexed before it can be extended fully , and any attempt to strike with a semi - extended	arm	is sure to fail because of the obvious weakness of the technique . The question is ,  how do you disguise the elbow flexion   One answer is to open with a reverse punch to the mid - section .	None
265	arm	4	Also ,  the opponent may fall in an unexpected direction ,  so that you have to spin around and perhaps take a step to reach him. By that time ,  of course ,  the element of surprise is lost and his guard is ready and waiting .  The remainder of the sequence then degenerates into a mle of pumping	arms	and legs . The hook At this point it is necessary to distinguish between foot sweeps and hooks .	None
266	arm	4	If they took a whirl at the minister ,  he would have a fine sight of the fun .  Two days ago when they had carted out Menzies the minister and Fleming the young teacher from along the road at Dull and danced round them like children at a Halloween fire and stuck them up on horses ,  facing backwards ,  and paraded them past the door and down the road to Aberfeldy ,  he had flung a soft carrot himself and caught the man on the side of his face .  He had deserved all he got was that what ministers and teachers were paid for  to draw up the militia lists and condemn the young men to the barracks and the camps , to swamp fever in the Indies and their legs and	arms	blown off  Young Donald  his eyes were clear black - brown ,  like a lochan stained with peat ,  his hair was curly like a bull 's  poll ,  and he had been a lovely lad until his father went away ,  clever with his hands ,  whittling pieces of wood and glueing them to make little windmills and watermills .  The wheel he had mounted on a bit of rod from Stewart 's  smithy still turned freely in the burn at the side of the kail - yard .	None
267	arm	4	Look  they are still flocking in .  A ripple of new arrivals was making the front row press forwards .  Cameron and Menzies were squeezed back nearly into the house , and big Mary , finding herself hard up against Menzies , took his	arm	, cleared a space with a sideways butt of her hip , and twirled once round with him. Come away ,  James !  she said loudly .  This is better  than a ceilidh .	None
268	arm	4	A pulse of pressure from behind threw them against the factor ,  he turned and jumped for the door ,  beat on it ,  it opened abruptly ,  and he fell inside .  Cameron turned and rose on tiptoe  the Grandtully crowd had arrived in force ,  the Duke of Lennox in the lead ,  he was striding across the grass with an oak - tree branch slanting across his chest like a sceptre ,  its green sprays nodding on his shoulder .  A piper marched beside him , the patched black bag of his pipes under his	arm	, the chanter blowing a reel . The Duke was revelling in the occasion ,  his toothless mouth curved up in a great leer like the mask of comedy .  When the boys saw him ,  they ran towards him ,  calling out shrilly Up the Duke !  he swung his sceptre at them and they ducked ,  shrieking .	None
269	arm	4	When the boys saw him ,  they ran towards him ,  calling out shrilly Up the Duke !  he swung his sceptre at them and they ducked ,  shrieking .  Shoals of people were coming up the drive from the west gate  Cameron recognized faces that he knew from the sawmill at Kenmore .  Amongst them walked a gentleman in an expensive greatcoat , his	arms	firmly held another hostage . Good tactics ,  whether planned or not  the more gentry were pinned down here ,  the fewer were left to muster the Volunteers or ride off with news to the Deputies at Blairgowrie .  Dust hung in the air now ,  making it yellow and the sun orange .	None
270	arm	4	He should be here by now .  And he was  a small figure in a drab coat ,  lurking at the side of the crowd ,  speaking to nobody .  MacDiarmid waved him forward with a commanding sweep of his	arm	and he came and sat at the end of the table . There was a pause while everyone present wondered how to proceed .  Abruptly the laird smiled ,  looking from face to face along the front row ,  and said ,  Well ,  well  it is a fine morning for it .	None
271	arm	4	Before the crowd could drift off ,  Cameron got up on the massive stone gate - post and called on them to swear an oath .  The words drew on his memory of a secret meeting he had gone to at the end of his first year in Glasgow .  It had looked like a melodrama a little group in a candle - lit attic , holding up their	arms	with fists clenched and swearing to do or die . But they had meant it ,  and he was eager now to bring everybody together in a fine ,  hard point of resolve ,  in case zeal slackened and died away in the holiday atmosphere of this soft ,  comfortable afternoon .  The hills themselves looked asleep ,  the heather glowed dust - blue in the hazy light ,  and the people ,  after a night of little sleep and hours of walking and standing ,  now looked stunned as they sat on the grassy banks ,  leaned on dykes ,  or lay on their backs in the hayfields ,  munching oatcakes and drinking the last of their water .	None
272	arm	4	Are we all resolved to finish this day 's  work   He looked from one tired face to another .  A few had turned on their sides in the hay and cradled their heads on their	arms	. All right .  We have started well .	None
273	arm	4	The little army was stirring to its feet ,  movement ran from front to back of the broad crowd like hackles rising .  Let me see your hands .  Hundreds of	arms	were standing up stiffly now like bristling branches . Let us bind ourselves now by this oath  say it with me .  We do swear  He paused ,  and a murmur followed him with some clearer ,  harsher voices audible amongst it :  We do swear  He went on :  Never to swerve ,  and they said it together ,  Never to swerve  from our present path  till we have cleansed the country  or this oppressive Act .	None
274	arm	4	They tramped along to Ballechin among the ferns and sheltering oaks ,  smelling the cheesey smell of cows among the mist .  Hope Steuart had felled a tree across the track ,  two men with cudgels were standing sentry behind it ,  they dropped the clubs and ran when the whole wood came at them ,  the darkness between the trees turned into people ,  people everywhere ,  herds and thickets of them surrounding the low tower - house .  Hope Steuart had leaned two loaded muskets against the doorjambs ; he turned to pick one up but the Duke 's two sons were on him , twisting his	arms	behind him. He struggled and roared out ,  I see you ,  James Menzies ,  I charge you with sedition ,  and the Duke roared back ,  We charge you  with tyranny ,  trail him round the house ,   lads ,  show his servants who is the master now .  They carted him like a scarecrow ,  his heels scoring the gravel ,  but he was as stubborn as a pig in a cart ,  he would never squeal without a hard prod ;  Donald Stewart the blacksmith had to grip his wrist to make him sign the paper .	None
275	arm	4	Well ,  well ,  well He put his foot between the two bottom rungs of the ladder and then caught at the upright to save himself from staggering .  Carefully he tried again but Cameron took his	arm	and told him not to hurry unduly , the joists had only been pinned in place and they were still waiting for the long nails from Grandtully . Work slowed to a halt until Donald Steuart clattered up on his cart and began to lift down hefty canvas bags from the tailboard .  Sorry ,  Angus ,  he was saying ,  my lad from Ballinluig never turned up ,  I had to get my father to blow the bellows  ouch !  some of them are still hot  that bag has charred ,  spread them out to cool ,  or keep them for tomorrow .

276	arm	4	James 's  had a brown mark on the leg the shape of an iron .  When Allan grinned knowingly at it ,  he said ,  Oh aye  this house needs a woman .  ,  Maybe we will find a willing girl at the wedding ,  Allan suggested .  Donald 's other daughters are like their father too hefty in the	arm	. No man will ever cow them .  Did I say a Stewart 	None
277	arm	4	Let us get on the road .  They stepped out briskly in the chill of evaporating rime and dew .  By the time they came to the sharp bend at Borlick they had caught up with the McCulloch family , old Donald limping and muttering to himself , Donald hand in hand with Jean , Mary and her friend big Mary striding on ahead , their	arms	pulled down by heavy baskets of pies and eggs . Where so old Iain Logan   said old Donald irritably as they came abreast .  They will have gone down by the other side ,  said Allan Stewart ,  it is their quickest way .	None
278	arm	4	To charm yourself a kingdom  The others took it up ,  humming or singing ,  and walked in time to it until old Donald got breathless and they had to saunter for a while .  jean had her	arm	round Donald 's waist now and from time to time she skipped , roused by the fighting spirits of the menfolk . Well before noon ,  beside a small church whose roof sagged under clumps of grass and willow - herb ,  they came to the bridge over to Grandtully and looked across at the dense little settlement ,  lumpish houses made of undressed river boulders with brown smoke streaming through their heather thatch ,  hovels of branches littered through the trees ,  a few solid cottages with level roof - trees .  It was a place of moss and mud and standing pools ,  myriads of flies twirled in the sun - rays ,  and dogs and children ran out to greet the newcomers in a raucous chorus .	None
279	arm	4	It finished ,  he tapped his foot ,  one two three four ,  and then he did launch into a jig ,  springy and violent .  Young Donald McCulloch whooped and two of the McLaggan girls whooped with him. Donald Steuart had his	arms	round his daughter and son - in - law. He squeezed them and kissed them and went off into the house .  Bumping noises came and he reappeared carrying a door .	None
280	arm	4	For a moment she looked furiously at Donald ,  her teeth bared like a cat 's  ,  then she shook her hair out ,  spattering Donald with bree and barley ,  and hauled him back into the dance .  Sandy McGlashan had taken out a little yellow fiddle and was adding a frenzied strum of strings to the piper 's   notes .  As the dancers changed partners , set to each other , backed away , then set again and spun with crossed arms , Donald McCulloch became masterful , gripping the girls ' hands strongly , spinning so hard that the balls of their feet ached on the cobbles , and passing them on with an almost lordly flourish of his	arm	. Jean felt belittled ;  for as long as the dance lasted she seemed no more to him than any girl there ,  but then he came round to her again and clasped her closely as they stepped it down the aisle between the lines of dancers .  Sandy McGlashan was wild now with the sound of his own music .	None

282	arm	4	As Cameron opened with his usual explanation of the Act ,  he did not know that the Reverend William McIvor ,  a tall whiskery man with coarse orange hair and very pale blue eyes ,  had stayed outside his manse ,  in the cover of a thick yew tree ,  and was listening hard with a hand cupped round his ear .  This Act will enslave you ,  he heard Cameron saying ,  and not only the young men among you but every family with a son who is in his prime .  For how are we to bring in the corn harvest with all those strong hands and strong	arms	gone  You will manage   oh yes  although you  have no servants to feed your animals or cook your meat for you  you will manage  ,  although you are a year married with a wee child learning to walk ,  and no wet - nurse to mind it for you while you milk the beasts  and no young husband to thatch your house above your head .  The lords in parliament ,  and in the courthouse and the castle ,  they do not know how we live  they know nothing about us ,  except that we will die for them ,  to protect their forts in India and in Scotland   his voice sharpened suddenly ,  his arm swung round and pointed north and a gust of response rose out of the crowd  we have always been good at that ,  their demands can never be satisfied ,  regiments for the colonies ,  indentured servants and labourers for the plantations ,  they have scoured Scotland like a killing wind and the men have been whirled away in the blast of it .

When the Philadelphia now remember this name when the Philadelphia put into Stornoway in Lewis , and gleaned young boys from the beach , and stowed them in the hold like trade - goods , what constable or what factor raised his	arm	or his stick to stop the slavers  When seven slave - ships  now this is true  when seven slave - ships were cruising in the sound between Taransay and Harris ,  did Lord MacDonald 's  men protect Lord MacDonald 's  tenants   Not at all  the price  was too good  MacDonald 's  factor was far too busy agreeing a price  for the young folk that he sold  to the Carolina merchants .

284	arm	4	There is a Bastille in every glen and firth ,  and this Act is the final fetter  ( but it would not be ,  there would be plenty more )  .  Let them put it on you and you are done for at last  food for the cannons ,  and the swamp - fever ,  and the hulks .  But remember he had lifted an	arm	now and was prodding with his forefinger as though pointing to the furthest corners of the country ( he was feeling the attention of the crowd and letting it recharge his energy ) , the people are mightier than a lord . He paused ,  letting the crowd dwell on the proverb  ( hearing the rooks caw above his head )  .  The people are mightier than a lord ,  and if we know that ,  we  can  not  be  put  down.	None
285	arm	1	He knocked his pipe out on the stone above the fire .  I wonder if they will take orders once they have red coats on ,  he said at last .

286	arm	4	You must decide .  They had built up the fabric in their minds again and could even feel some weary well - being as they neared Weem and saw it sheltering between the steep hills and the flood plain of the Tay .  The low lands were patched with hayfields at every stage of readiness , from bleached yellow to ferny green , and across the coloured surfaces people moved as though they were stitching and knitting at its texture ,	arms	pulling on rakes , backs stooped under burdens on their way to the steadings . Far up on the left ,  above the inn and the cottage row ,  two other figures moved ,  blue and white ,  not haymakers  Jean Bruce and young Donald ,  walking hand in hand amongst the bents of a neglected field at the furthest point of the McCullochs '  holding .  For years it had not been worked .	None
287	arm	4	Below them the strath spread its pattern like a map .  I feel like a bird ,  said Jean .  She held out her	arms	and spread her fingers gracefully , pleasuring herself in Donald 's admiration . As he looked at her ,  his face closed over with a faintly embarrassed incredulity .  A bird   he chaffed her .	None
288	arm	4	Over his shoulder she was looking at the derelict house .  Should she mention it now   She let him kiss her , his tongue on hers , and then she eased him on across the field , her	arm	curved closely round his waist . Who lived here ,  Don   she asked him. They parted a way through the tough bracken that choked the enclosure and their feet found the path to the front door .	None
289	arm	4	He went in doubtingly .  Mary was kneeling with her head and shoulders inside the dark cave of a box - bed .  She turned and Cameron saw , under her	arm	, old Donald 's face , eyes staring fixedly , his mouth drooping at one side , a shine of saliva on his chin . Mary  what is ado    Father has  Father has  oh ,  he is very ill ,  it took him yesterday .	None
290	arm	4	I said to be chary of the McLaggans  No no ,  there is no harm really .  Only I went to Donald Stewart 's  smithy and Mary was there ,  chatting to her mother ,  so by the time I had fixed things up with Donald and went along to Grandtully to explain the plan to Alex ,  Mary had already gone back and told him. Ah , young love she was sitting with her	arm	round him , crying silently . She looked like Kirsty when I first went off to Bengal  Menzies stopped ,  his own eyes watering ,  while Cameron let his temper sink back to normal after the gratuitous alarm .  What does the Duke say ,  then 	None
291	arm	4	In the darkness horses loomed .  A squeak and trundle of wheels  the post - chaise from the inn .  Cameron and Menzies felt themselves half - lifted inside by the	arms	. Then they were rocking past the shut faces of the village houses towards the black thickets down the river .  In the gloaming before sunrise they saw each other 's  features as pale apparitions .	None
292	arm	4	A sharp shout of command  twelve troopers ranged themselves across the road .  The people had stopped in their tracks ,  women were making their children stand behind them .  Three men stepped forward to meet Colberg : Donald Stewart , a gun across his	arm	, Donald McLaggan , holding a shaft with a curved blade at its end , and someone unknown to Cameron and Menzies , also with a gun . Colberg drew his sabre slowly and held it sloped on his shoulder .  He looked elegant ,  as though presenting arms in some courtly ritual .	None

295	arm	4	Leonard was actually looking in a shop window when he first saw them ,  noticing Marianne  naturally  first !  She took his breath away ,  as she did most men 's  .  He never realised , on that eventful day , that she would come into my	arms	( as he put it ) and stay there for so many years , adding in no small degree to the legends of love which keep the world sane and hopeful . There was serious work ,  however ,  at hand for Leonard .  His writing ,  prose and poetry demanded rigorous attention ,  and received it with the same daily routine that he had established earlier :  three pages a day ,  writing and rewriting ,  creative and self - critical .	None
296	arm	4	Nudists .  People with no clothes on .  She could lie in the sun ; the wind could blow all over her , even , with careful positioning , the neglected places under her	arms	.

297	arm	2	On either side furniture was piled in high ,  precarious heaps .  She could distinguish desks ,  tom chairs ,  filing cabinets and Beautility tables .  Further away , in the dim recesses of the shop , the individual items merged together , with just a leg discernible here , an upholstered	arm	protruding there . She stepped forward and discovered ,  sitting at a desk which stood the right way up ,  a small dark man. Your business cannot hope to succeed ,  she announced ,  her voice booming in the narrow space .	None
298	arm	4	If they were both standing ,  perhaps having drinks with friends ,  she would lean towards him and her glass would tilt and spill .  Her hands also behaved unexpectedly .  The heel of one of them might massage his	arm	or the rough texture of his cheek . Some of these incidents occurred ,  regrettably ,  in public .  Even after marriage ,  even in the bed in which she was now trying to lie disturbingly still ,  Tom was embarrassed by the caresses that brought Rita such pleasure .	None

304	arm	4	The young ,  dark man looked at it lying on the floor .  He rose ,  walked round the table and picked up the skein .  He touched the woman on her	arm	and she turned and smiled up at him. He smiled back ,  dropped the silk in front of her and returned to his drawing .  Trevor went on talking to Derek :  The Luctians preserve Vascar limbs ,  he said .	None

The boat owner seized them ,  twisted the hooks from their mouths and tossed the fish ,  tails still flapping ,  into a bucket .	None
309	arm	4	Sometimes still ,  those greeny eyes .  She 's  glad Jeff 's  are brown .  An impression only of Niall 's black hair flying , awkward jumble on her hearthrug of	arms	and legs .

It was her nail scissors that she 'd been searching for days ,  lost under the hearthrug and pressing into her hip ;  and the cry was also her virginity ,  small and bewildered and gone .	None

348	arm	4	The pectoralis minor lies underneath the pectoralis major and in almost all cases any reference to the pecs means the pectoralis major .  The pecs respond fairly quickly regular training ,  especially the bench press .  The main function of pecs is to adduct the	arms	across the body as in dumb - bell flyes . Other movements brought about by the pecs are shoulder flexion ,  which draws the arm forwards and upwards ,  and shoulder extension ,  which draws the arm down and forwards .  By working the pecs from different angles it is possible to direct the work - load to different parts of the muscle .	None
349	arm	4	After the legs ,  the back is the most neglected area in terms of training and development .  The reason for this is very simple  you ca n't see it .  An individual will get far more pleasure working his chest , his abdominals or his	arms	because he can see the muscles working and developing . Also ,  it is much harder to train the back muscles and receive a hard pump .  The back consists of 3 main sections ;  the lower ,  the middle and the upper back .	None
350	arm	4	The main muscles of the middle back are the latissimus dorsi and the lower trapezius .  The latissimus dorsi account for the very impressive V shape of athletes and bodybuilders .  These muscles draw the	arms	to the sides , therefore all rowing exercises , pull - ups or pull - downs are performed by them . Swimmers often have very good lat development due to the fact that the arms are drawn towards the body in most styles of swimming .  The lats can be exercised for width or thickness .	None

Swimmers often have very good lat development due to the fact that the	arms	are drawn towards the body in most styles of swimming . The lats can be exercised for width or thickness .  The best exercises for developing width are wide grip pull - ups to the back of the neck and lat pull - downs .	None
352	arm	4	The best exercises for developing width are wide grip pull - ups to the back of the neck and lat pull - downs .  Exercises to develop thickness include seated rowing .  bent - over rowing , T bar rowing and single	arm	rowing . These latter exercises also work the lower trapezius muscles and the rhomboids .  The main muscle of the upper back is the upper trapezius .	None
353	arm	4	The skeletal width of the shoulders is hereditary but an illusion of breadth can be created by fully developing the shoulder muscles .  These muscles are called the deltoids and have 3 heads ;  anterior  ( front )  ,  lateral  ( side )  and posterior  ( rear )  .  The heads form a cap which covers the shoulder joint , and they are attached at one end to the upper	arm	and at the other end to 3 points to the front , top and back of the shoulder . The function of the deltoids is to raise the arm to the front ,  the side and the rear .  All 3 of the heads of the deltoids are involved in shoulder movements ,  but the direction of the arm movement determines which head is being used the most .	None
354	arm	4	These muscles are called the deltoids and have 3 heads ;  anterior  ( front )  ,  lateral  ( side )  and posterior  ( rear )  .

All 3 of the heads of the deltoids are involved in shoulder movements ,  but the direction of the arm movement determines which head is being used the most .  The most impressive shoulder development shows an equal development of all 3 heads of the deltoids .	None
355	arm	4	ARM TRAINING The balance between biceps and triceps development is perhaps one of the most difficult to achieve in physique development .  The triceps make up 60 % of the upper	arm	while the biceps make up only 40 % and yet it is still the case that most people tend to have overdeveloped biceps . There are two reasons for this .  Firstly ,  training the biceps is very enjoyable and the results are easily seen .	None
356	arm	4	Firstly ,  training the biceps is very enjoyable and the results are easily seen .  Secondly ,  the biceps respond very quickly to training and are relatively easy to develop compared to the triceps .  Upper	arm	training should be in the ratio of 3 : 2 for triceps to biceps . It is always best to train the triceps first because these are usually the least developed group .  There are 3 heads to the triceps ;  2 of them have their origins on the humerus and the third originates on the shoulder blade .	None
357	arm	4	Higher repetitions must be used because the muscle type is denser and more resilient  ( like the calves )  .  Wrist rolling is probably one of the best exercises to perform .  This involves holding out a bar at	arm	's length and then rotating it . A weight can be tied to the bar by a piece of rope and then raised and lowered to make the exercise more difficult .  One final point to remember is that it is very easy to overtrain the arms .	None

Stretching The benefits of stretching for people from all sports and of all ages cannot be overemphasised .	None
360	arm	3	At risk of seeming a killjoy ,  I would urge readers to think through the implications of all home - made safety devices which set out to resolve some well - acknowledged safety problem only to create others of a less obvious by more hazardous nature .  Remembering that anything that bodes to threaten concentration in wood - machining is a prime risk ,  let us consider a router cutter revolving at anything up to 24,000rpm sitting midway between 12 highly unstably - sprung devices whose proper purpose in life is the support of wet laundry on a clothes line .  It takes little imagination to foretell the likely consequences of just one peg disintegrating and flinging its spring or its free	arm	into the cutter gap during a pass ; or the possible knock - on effect ( s ) on the rest of the makeshift assembly and the astonished operator if this should happen . There have been better hold - down devices of a home - made nature in Woodworker  in the past  the best of them doubtless designed after some careful thoughts about an acceptable specification .  Mr Wiseman does n't only have the safety of his hands to consider :  in this case he might stand to lose his sight or sustain laceration from bits of flying clothespegs ,  blocks and cramps into the bargain .	None
361	arm	4	You do not want to get trapped by detail .  Start general rounding off ,  and at this stage ,  some form of modelling could be tackled ;  working on deep folds ,  light creases and facial features .  Carefully observing the model , George concentrated on the tiny creases in the ears , on	arms	and legs . the paws ;  simulating the stitching and seams ,  merely suggesting the heavy black braid that defines the nose of the original bear .  All the details that help breathe life into the little fellow can be marked with a pencil or Biro .	None
362	arm	3	The brackets must end up with their two oblique edges absolutely square ,  and each bracket must be identical .  I was making 24 of these and needed a repetitive method .  I 'm not sure that a radial -	arm	saw is accurate enough for this at the best of times , but , at the moment , mine rattles up and down its rails like a train in the sidings , and is definitely not fit for the job . I shot the longer edge down on the planer .  If you need to change angle to land on the line ,  you take two slight passes ,  the first either stopping with the wood still on the back table ,  or starting with it already on the front table ,  depending which way you want to tilt .	None
363	arm	3	Each one has inherent hazards .  I tried to arrange guides on the drum sander but quickly gave up. My bandsaw competes with the radial -	arm	for clatters and bangs so the big router won with a large chamfer bit . Two strips of waste wood were slowly fed over the revolving cutter and cramped to the table .  These pointed fingers were adjusted to be my guide and ,  apart from the very ends of each cut ,  were quite reliable .	None
364	arm	4	I 'm stealing everything I can !  Tall and elegantly mustachioed ,  David Esterly is a softly spoken Californian in his mid - forties whose passion for Grinling Gibbons takes him by surprise even today .  I was walking down Piccadilly in 1973 with the woman who was later to become my wife when she grabbed me by the	arm	and steered me into St James 's church to see the carvings . What followed dictated the course of his life .  It was a conversion experience ,  he says ,  I had seen his carvings in a vague sort of way already Esterly was then a post - graduate student at Cambridge and surrounded by some of Gibbons '  best work but I found myself looking at them there in St James 's  as if for the first time .	None
365	arm	4	For the first time we are trying to preserve the historical integrity of the carvings .  The restoration work has brought to light tricks of the Gibbons trade .  As they lie on the benches within	arm	's reach , the foliage compositions initially shock by their scale . Tulips and rushes seem implausible large .  But that ,  says the quiet American ,  is all part of the art .	None
366	arm	4	In following Stravinsky 's  guidelines ,  Ashton found many new ,  sometimes frivolous ,  ways of performing class - room steps .  The corps de ballet  neglect the turn - out and step forwards sur les pointes  ,  raising the working knee and resting the toe on the calf of the other leg ,  before moving forwards .  They travel forwards instead of en place in chapp relevs after breaking the rule that the	arms	never cross the centre line of the body and are always ( except in arabesque ) rounded . If Ashton 's  Scnes de Ballet  is compared with Balanchine 's  Ballet Imperial  ,  it will be seen that Balanchine rarely breaks away from the classical technique as practised in petipa 's  day when Tchaikovsky wrote the music .  Ashton ,  like Stravinsky ,  took into account the technical developments which had taken place .	None
367	arm	4	Dancers easily understand how a series of swift pas de bourre courus   ( i.e. running on the toes )  as danced by the Queen of the Wilis in Giselle  ,  differs from the same step performed piqu   ( i.e. each foot picked up sharply at each change of weight )  ,  as in many of petipa 's  solos .  But it is not always easy to decide which is the more appropriate ,  nor how the two ways mentioned can lead to other versions .  for example , in her solo in Ashton 's Cinderella the Winter Fairy moves across the stage in a series of pas de bourre en tournant terre , the feet weaving their in - and - out pattern as the	arms	flick to and fro sparkling with frost . In Symphonic  Variations  ,  the dancers perform pas de bourre piqus sur les pointes  very gently because they are marking the rhythmic beat as the soloist dances to the melodic phrase .  This is an excellent example where both the overall and shorter phrase rhythms are explicitly brought to life by the dance design  ( see page 68 )  .	None
368	arm	4	In Symphonic  Variations  ,  the dancers perform pas de bourre piqus sur les pointes  very gently because they are marking the rhythmic beat as the soloist dances to the melodic phrase .  This is an excellent example where both the overall and shorter phrase rhythms are explicitly brought to life by the dance design  ( see page 68 )  .  One of the most beautiful uses of pas de bourre courus is when Ashton places his danseuse in her partner 's	arms	as she floats over the surface of the floor as if in a dream like ecstasy . It is a movement he has used many times and which is perhaps seen at its best in the pas de deux  to the Meditation  from Thai - s  created for Anthony Dowell and Antoinette Sibley ;  in A Month in the Country  when Natalia dances with the Tutor to express her emotions ;  and in Les Deux Pigeons  in the final pas de deux  ,  when the Young Man has returned to The Girl and tenderly dances with her in his arms  ( see page 83 )  .  It was this ability to display a ballerina 's  apparent weightlessness and sheer joy in dance that was so impressive when the Spirits of the Air danced in Homage to the  Queen  ,  Ashton 's  exquisite celebration of the 1952 Coronation which was danced by Margot Fonteyn and Michael Somes .	None
369	arm	4	But such jumps can also travel some way forwards ,  backwards or sideways and can become sparklingly light when the knees are sharply bent upwards at the height of the jump .  This is required of the Four Fairies ,  the Fairy Godmother and the Stars in Ashton 's  Cinderella  .  However if this way of jumping from two feet to two feet had not been combined with well picked - up pas de bourre piqus and relevs retirs as well as extremely accurate , quick ports de bras with straighter and more angled than rounded	arms	, they would have seemed out of place . When moving dancers from two feet to one in both open and closed sissonnes  ,  the choreographer can make the movements dart over the floor as Aurora does in her final solo in The Sleeping Beauty  .  In Les Patineurs  and Les Rendezvous  Ashton makes his dancers travel upwards as well in an effort to show off their abilities to keep up with the music and beat each other to the exit .	None
370	arm	4	It can be that magic moment in such dances as the Rose Adage in The  Sleeping Beauty  when Aurora triumphantly raises her hand from the fourth Prince 's  grasp and holds the final attitude  for several seconds revealing her complete command over the forces of gravity .  There are hundreds of instances of this kind of pose created by many different choreographers .  There is the moment in the Act II pas de deux or Swan Lake where Odette appears to fly away in an arabesque before Siegfried seizes her	arms	and draws her body close to his in an embrace . There are also the exciting poses that come at the end of some of Ashton 's  pas de deux  as the two characters declare their love ,  for example ,  when Oberon cradles Titania in his arms at the end of The Dream  and ,  even more excitingly ,  when Colas lifts Lise high on one arm it the end of their dance in Act II of La Fille Mai Garde  as if to crown her queen of the harvest In some modern classical ballets too little attention is paid to the momentary holding of a pose as the focus of a picture to sum up  as it were  what has gone before .	None
371	arm	4	For example  :  in Choros  he focuses attention on many ancient Greek dance rituals and accents the playful use of movement whilst at the same time showing that such warlike ,  athletic courtship and other activities are a wonderful game to be played by the performers .  In Consort Lessons  these quick changes of aulement  give much greater variety and dimension to the overall design particularly where the solo girl dances with four boys .  More recently , in his The Sons of Horus he has found ways of incorporating the profiled attitudes and poses seen in ancient Egyptian designs with straight turned - in legs , elongated lines and angled	arms	, all in contrast to the turnedout legs and curving bodies of classical dance . As Ashton and MacMillan in many of their ballets ,  he has created a style appropriate to one particular ballet .  Unless he chooses another ancient Egyptian theme he is unlikely to use the same style again .	None
372	arm	4	Petipa 's  remark that without ports de bras  the dancer is dumb is only one of the wise comments he made when working on his choreographic designs .  Fokine echoed this remark when he said every step and pose is a gesture  ( see page 58 )  .  De Valois summed up the ideas of these two great choreographers by saying : Only synchronisation of	arms	and legs will give symmetry to step and pose , strength to the jump , speed to the pirouettes , calm to the adage and spaciousness to the dance . To ensure that his audience would appreciate each sentence in his dance ,  petipa usually repeated each at least twice and usually four times .  But towards the end of the second or fourth repeat he made some small alteration in the ports de bras  so that the dancer could move easily into the next sentence .	None
373	arm	4	This is particularly noticeable in his variations for the Six fairies in The Sleeping Beauty  .  Petipa clearly reflects in dance the gift that each fairy brings to the Christening .  The first Fairy is slow and gracious to denote Beauty ; she encircles her face with her hand and displays the line of her	arm	( the traditional gesture for beauty ) . The Second Fairy brings Grace and dances slightly faster in such a way that she shows off the lines of her body as it faces forwards and then backwards  ( the traditional gesture )  .  The Third Fairy dances slowly sur les pointes  and uses conventional hand movements to show she brings the gift of Plenty ,  just as the godmother at a Russian christening scatters breadcrumbs over the cradle .	None
374	arm	0	But if Ashton had not made these very distinctive changes in his ports de bras  ,  the seasonal differences would not have been so notable .  The above examples are only a few of those showing how conventional ports de  bras  can be changed .  A study of Ashton 's ways of using them , or of MacMillan 's , reveal how unnecessary it is to keep passing the	arms	through 1st position . Nor is it necessary always to keep the arms rounded except in arabesque  .  Examples taken from both choreographers '  works describe the particular feelings ,  moods and emotions of the characters their dancers are portraying .	None

376	arm	4	Examples taken from both choreographers '  works describe the particular feelings ,  moods and emotions of the characters their dancers are portraying .  Arms flick to and fro as the Winter Fairy and the Stars of Ashton 's  Cinderella  give the illusion of twinkling lights in the frosty air .  The poignant shaking of the hands above upraised heads followed by the pressing downwards , outwards and then backwards of the	arms	make an overwhelming plea for pity in MacMillan 's Requiem . The fact that the two leading English choreographers create so many unusual ports de bras  as a means of expression is what has made so  many Royal Ballet dancers so successful in ballets with a story .  Coming from a country where the use of the appropriate word is more important than a gesture in daily life ,  both choreographers have resolved that words must be replaced by gestures within the choreographic design .	None
377	arm	4	Any untoward or awkward transition is immediately noticeable because it destroys the calm dignity that the human body needs if it is to be shown at its best .  This does not mean that speed must be avoided ,  nor that the unexpected need offend the eye .  A sudden change of aulement , an unusual turn in - out of legs or	arms	, or quick jumps up and then down to the floor followed by a roll over or even a somersault can accentuate the particular place that unusual movement has in the whole design . Swift changes in the dimensions covered in any linear design are nowhere more obvious than in Ashton 's  five abstract ballets and his example is now being followed by David Bintley in his Choros  and Consort Lessons  .  In fact such unusual movements often arouse the audience to gentle laughter as swift changes add a touch of humour as two or more dancers compete to capture the attention of both the audience and their Colleagues .	None
378	arm	4	Later the mass of dancers merely moves upstage sur les pointes  to a pose and further ports de  bras  ,  then returns downstage to another slowly unfolding set of ports de bras  and arabesques  .  It is when this mass of dancers divides and moves to the sides that the open space available for dancing is exposed fur the first time .  Before this the slowmoving dancers in their wide spreading tutus and veiled	arms	have hidden it from view . Its exposure prepares the audience for the brilliant solos to follow .  When Marie Camargo shortened her skirts and removed the heels from her shoes ,  jumps and batterie  first entered the vocabulary .	None
379	arm	4	The demi - caractre  style has its roots in classical technique ,  but must be coloured by more clearly defined and individual movements which allow the dancers to show they are playing the part of some character who has some claim to live in the real world and therefore can be recognised as such .  In other words they usually ,  dance classically from their feet to the waist and above that are free to express themselves as people of more definite behaviour ,  work ,  play and age  ( de Valois in a lecture to teachers ,  1947 )  .  The head , body and	arms	of the characters portrayed should show the status they have in the society to which they belong whether it is rural , urban or fantastic , as well as their behaviour , customs , work or play . Dauberval 's  La Fille Mal Gard   ( 1789 )  was the first ballet in this style .  Dauberval 's  exclusion from the Acadmie Royale  ( later the Paris Opera )  was justified by those in charge because they felt his idea of making farmers ,  peasants and the like the heroes and heroines of his ballets was beneath the dignity of an opera house whose stage had hitherto been occupied with the deeds of noble heroes ,  heroines and courts .	None
380	arm	4	Dauberval 's  exclusion from the Acadmie Royale  ( later the Paris Opera )  was justified by those in charge because they felt his idea of making farmers ,  peasants and the like the heroes and heroines of his ballets was beneath the dignity of an opera house whose stage had hitherto been occupied with the deeds of noble heroes ,  heroines and courts .  Bournonville coloured his ballets with movements characteristic of many different personalities and nationalities .  In his particular style of demi - caractre dance he used classical footwork for most of the time but , from the waist upwards through the body ,	arms	and head , he tried to convey how his performers worked and played in the environment to which they belonged . for example :  in Napoli  they were Italian ,  in Far from Denmark  they were Danes influenced by the dance of South America .  This way of creating more plebeian characters is fully demonstrated in Ashton 's  comic masterpiece La Fille Mal Garde  ,  where this style of dance is shown in two different aspects ,  the light - hearted yet technically highly expert dancing of Lise and Colas and the comically eccentric work of Alain and the Cock and Hens .	None
381	arm	4	But by the time Fokine produced The Firebird  he had developed his mimed dance much further .  It had become the most important part of his choreography .  His Firebird flew and still flies in all her glory before being trapped pitifully in the	arms	of the Tsarevich . Her release sends her soaring in grands jets en avant  through the magic garden .  This flight of the magic bird held and stili holds audiences spellbound .	None
382	arm	4	As traditional Italian dances are often sung ,  the performers pose solemnly fur a second or two at the end of each phrase .  This was a feature widely used by nineteenth - century Italian balletmasters and by Bournonville .  But the latter 's pause was often to hold the dancers in perfect 5th positions of both	arms	and feet . Spanish style  The stereotyped Spanish style is possibly seen at its best in Petipa 's  Don Quixote  ,  most particularly in the famous pas de deux  fur the ballerina and her partner .	None
383	arm	4	Spanish style  The stereotyped Spanish style is possibly seen at its best in Petipa 's  Don Quixote  ,  most particularly in the famous pas de deux  fur the ballerina and her partner .  The tone is set by the continual use of the pose with head held high , back slightly arched ,	arms	in closed 4th or a stretch fully upwards in 5th sur les pointes for Kitri or on demi - pointes for Basil . The brilliant bravura variation when Kitri springs lightly forwards sur les  pointes  whilst fanning herself and Basil attempts to make his zapateado  ( heel - tapping )  appear authentic by the slightly crouching pose of his body ,  add even greater panache to their efforts .  Swanhilda strikes similar poses with her mantilla and fan in Copplia  and so do the Spanish dancers in Swan Lake  .	None
384	arm	4	The working leg is thrust outwards on the first beat of a bar ,  heels click and stamp to accent the appropriate beats .  Although the solo danseuses  perform sur les pointes  ,  they still mark the appropriate beats by stabbing their toes into the floor ,  i.e. they dance a series of retirs passs  forwards or backwards without descending and use typical Hungarian ports de bras  .  These are also strongly accented as the	arms	straighten into 2nd position before being bent , with hands sometimes clasped behind the head , sometimes placed akimbo on the waist or sometimes with one on the waist and the other behind the large bow at the back of the head - dress . The danseuses  perform some of the traditional steps such as the sideways moving pas de bourre  danced sur les pointes  and the sideways cabrioie  rarely used in classical ballet .   The unusual feature of traditional Hungarian style is the strong distinction made between the two parts of most folk dances .	None
385	arm	4	This made the dancers appear as if they were a moving frieze .  Something that David Bintley was also to achieve later in his Sons of Horus   ( 1985 )  .  Ashton too has created two oriental styled ballets in which the delicacy of the hands and	arms	drew attention to the way such subtle movements can take the place of words . His interest in ports de bras  nearly always produces something new to say ,  whether it is to tell a story ,  describe the characters and/or create a style exclusive to one work .  Japanese  The first of Ashton 's  ballets in oriental style was Madame Chrysanthme  ,  in which he utilised many traditional japanese gestures made more fascinating by emphasis of his dainty ballerina 's  footwork .	None
386	arm	4	It also conveys the mood and emotions of the Girl ,  a very rare happening in true folk dance .  The participants in folk dance can and certainly do show elation .  In La Fille Mal Garde Mother Simone does this when she triumphantly finishes her Clog Dance on the	arms	linked to celebrate . The gestures of such pastoral characters as Lise and Colas in La Fille Mal Garde  have already been noted  (  - see page 100 )  as well as that of Lise churning and helping her Mother to spin .  But the conventional gesture to spin ' has often been used in ballet .	None
387	arm	4	Fokine 's  advice to those wishing to create the romantic style of dance was much as fur demi - caractre  when he said :  The choreographer should base his design on classical technique from the feet to the waist ,  but above that the dancer 's  head ,  body and arms must be free to express the moods ,  emotions and actions of the character in the story or theme to be communicated .  This style was first created by Taglioni for his daughter Marie .  The tale of La Sylphide gave him an opportunity to exploit her expressive	arms	and face as well as her ability to dance sur les pointes . Perrot developed the style in his dances fur Carlotta Grisi in Giselle  .  It was then expanded by Fokine and used in both grave and gay moods in Les Sylphides  and Le Carnaval  ,  where it is particularly expressive of both meaning and music .	None
388	arm	4	Ondine ,  the sea nymph  ( Margot Fonteyn )  so used her feet that she appeared always to float through water .  This was done by a series of pas marchs  each of which softly rose and fell through her feet from toe to heel .  They were co - ordinated with a soft undulating movement of the	arms	. Ashton thus created a special style fur a particular character which summed up  as it were  her whole being ,  but which would have been unsuitable for any other ballet .  B  Once Fokine had demonstrated that mimed dance and danced mime were the best materials to use in ballets where individual characters had to stand out from the rest of the cast ,  and particularly when true love did not run smoothly ,  other choreographers .  followed suit .	None
389	arm	4	He stood silent and still ,  watching the tragedy of the Poor Girl who was being rejected by the Rich Man .  His two tiny gestures said everything and expressed the audience 's  understanding of the plot .  He made one as if he should try and comfort her , but turned away , walked upstage and on the balcony with his back to the audience , raised his	arms	widely only to drop them helplessly . No one could fail to understand the Onlooker 's  reaction to the tale just unfolded .  To some extent the same idea of an onlooker applies to that of Jaeger ,  the critic in Enigma Variations  .	None
390	arm	4	The latter 's  vicious slap on the child 's  face explains more than any other gesture Natalia 's  selfishness .  Yet the Tutor 's  capitulation to Natalia reveals her power over every man she meets as well as his failure to withstand her wiles .  Ashton 's careful build - up to this climax makes Vera 's discovery of them in each other 's	arms	all the more poignant because she shows a child - like petulance at losing one she so longed to have for her own . It is so unlike Natalia 's  reaction when finding the Tutor and Vera together .  The Tutor remains a sympathetic character fur Vera ,  s sorrow at his departure is echoed by Kolia ,  Natalia 's  son ,  when he too realises he is losing the only person who has tried to make him happy .	None
391	arm	4	If choreographers study the above works of Ashton and MacMillan ,  they will understand how far the art of choreography has developed since Fokine changed its structure and texture .  They will perhaps understand even better if they pay particular attention to the fine details of every movement .  It is no longer the case that the romantic style means dancing classically from the feet to the waist and above that allowing the body ,	arms	and head to express themselves to describe the moods , emotions and actions of the characters . It is well known that only a great dancer - artist can suggest the development of the sixteen - year - old Aurora ,  happy at her birthday ,  into the dreamy figure the Prince meets in the woodland glade and on to her final entrance as a triumphant princess fully awake to her responsibilities as Queen - to - be .  The enchanements  she dances  thoughout  the three scenes do not change in style or content .	None
392	arm	4	Yet if the dances of Vera and Natalia in A Month in the Country  and Juliet in Romeo and Juliet  are examined it will be discovered how the technical content is so designed that the steps ,  poses and gestures show how changing circumstances are affecting the individuals .  This is what Perrot first attempted with his five leitmotifs for Giselle   ( see page 61 )  .  Continual development in the choreographic design is very obvious in the quiver of the raised leg as the Tutor takes Natalia in his	arms	. It shows her growing emotional involvement and gradually seems to affect her every movement .  This same tiny movement also appears when Vera begins to dance with the Tutor ,  but her movement is not so intense .	None
393	arm	4	Juliet then becomes the slightly apprehensive debutante at the Ball where her movements ,  though tentative ,   are conventionally correct when she dances with Paris .  The moment she encounters Romeo and senses somehow that her life has changed her movement becomes more purposeful .  From there onwards it becomes stronger and more emotional so that her joyous movements and later abandon in Romeo 's	arms	are in absolute contrast to her later dance with Paris . Her movements then are equally purposeful but they are constricted and withdrawn ,  so that her father 's  contemptuous rejection of her pleas and his throwing her to the floor seem the proper outcome of what in his eyes is sheer disobedience .  It is her final passionate abandon on discovering Romeo 's  body that demonstrates how overwhelming sorrow can destroy all sense of discipline over both body and mind .	None
394	arm	4	In the same way as conventional gesture  ( see page 88 )  ,  it has its rules which were formulated by John Davies in Orchestra ,  A Poem of Dancing  ( 1594 )  .  In it he discusses the Motions seven that are in Nature found  ( Stanza 73 )  .  These rules give the directions into which the head , body and	arms	should move when expressing certain moods , emotions and actions . 1 Upwards and outwards The head ,  body and arms rise upwards and outwards in all the happy emotions as can be seen in the final dances of The Sleeping Beauty ,  La  Fille Mal Garde  and Daphnis and Chlo  .	None
395	arm	4	These rules give the directions into which the head ,  body and arms should move when expressing certain moods ,  emotions and actions .  1 Upwards and outwards The head , body and	arms	rise upwards and outwards in all the happy emotions as can be seen in the final dances of The Sleeping Beauty , La Fille Mal Garde and Daphnis and Chlo . If the movement only goes upwards it usually means pride or arrogance .  2 Downwards and inwards	None
396	arm	4	The movements are more or less directed sideways ,  i.e. cart  or effac  ,  as in the dances fur Romeo ,  Mercutio and Benvolio in Romeo and Juliet  and fur the Tutor in A Month in the Country  .  4 Sideways closed  (  crois  )  If the character moves sideways with the head , body and	arms	in some way averted from the front , i.e. crois , possibly with a twist of the shoulders , he or she is usually playing some evil or cunning person . One of the finest examples used to be de Valois '  dance for the Three Comforters in Job  .  Their twisted cunning movements were vividly contrasted with those she created for Elihu ,  the personification of Youth and Truth .	None
397	arm	0	Bodies should be fully stretched upwards and curved either slightly forwards or backwards from the waist only .  This stance must be accompanied by the wellrecognised ports de bras  ,  which must be accurately co - ordinated with the footwork .  The	arms	usually change after each brief enchanement . Their movement also depends upon which foot is in front .  If the right foot remains there for several bars ,  the arms will be held still ,  but as soon as the left moves in front the arms will change .	None
398	arm	4	The arms usually change after each brief enchanement  .  Their movement also depends upon which foot is in front .  If the right foot remains there for several bars , the	arms	will change . There is also a tendency to pause in a pose at the end of a phrase and for a deliberate change to be made before further dance .  An interesting point to note in real Spanish folk dance is that the boy and girl rarely touch each other.	None
399	arm	4	By so phrasing each paragraph and bringing each incident to a proper conclusion ,  Nijinska gives both dancers and audience time to consider what has been done and what is yet to happen .  The nature of the formal shapes made by the dancers '  bodies and limbs as they move into and hold a picture must be evaluated .  Nijinska insisted on the use of the pointes in order to emphasise the elongated portraits of the Byzantine Saints , thus the dancers ' bodies mostly face the audience but their	arms	and legs turn inwards and are seen mostly in profile . The angles made at the elbows ,  shoulders ,  knees and ankle joints are clearly visible .  Those of the arms are particularly interesting because the fists are either clenched or the fingers flattened thus the lines and shapes made only appear slightly rounded by the folds in the sleeves .	None
400	arm	4	Technical characteristics It is the very particular choreographic style that MacMillan created for the child - like figure in Requiem  that emphasises more strongly than any other of today 's  ballets the need for choreographers to explore dance itself .  Only when they have examined what hands ,	arms	, legs and feet , body and above all the head can do in isolation and then in harmony with the story , theme or music , can they set out and create a style which will be general in structure and particular in texture , with the right quality , mood , emotion , action and character . The structure will determine the lines and shapes needed to fill the dimensions and ,  when needed ,  help to create the atmosphere and mood of the whole .

While the students looked to the West , China 's hardline leadership has found its inspiration in the pre - glasnost Soviet Union of Stalinist aesthetics - muscular	arms	, square jaws and stiff poses . The official blurb explains that the plaster figures stand as if boldly forging ahead ,  their eyes fixed on our motherland 's  beautiful future .  Perhaps unwittingly ,  the new statue hints at a deeper truth underpinning the hardline triumph :  the worker ,  the peasant and the intellectual gaze wistfully towards the Forbidden City ,  the grandest monument to the genius of Chinese civilisation ,  but the soldier has his eyes fixed in a different direction  down the Avenue of Eternal Peace towards Zhongnanhai ,  the walled compound where party leaders live and work .

421	arm	5	The price tag of almost 100m ,  and the fact that Fuji has agreed to a minority stake ,  has clearly also provided Mr Branson with reassurance  if he needed any  that taking Virgin private last year was the right thing to do .  Virgin paid 248m last year to remove the group from the scrutiny of the City ,  saying the business was misunderstood and the stock undervalued .  Less than a year later , Fuji seems more than willing to pay 100m for a minority share in the music	arm	which , with sales of 260m , represents much less than half of the Virgin empire . What remains a mystery is how Virgin would have fared had its directors decided to weather the storms in the stock market .

424	arm	4	As a young doctor in Leiden he paid a seminal visit to the neuroanatomist WJH Nauta ,  at that time developing a revolutionary anatomical technique for investigating the nervous system by staining degenerating fibres cut off from their parent cell - bodies .  Kuypers was the first to use this technique in studies of the brain and over the next 10 years ,  now in the United States ,  he charted at a new level of detail the connections made by the cerebral cortex with nervous elements in the brain - stem and spinal cord that control movement in a number of higher mammals .  Kuypers then started a long series of collaborative studies in which injuries to some of these connections in the monkey 's brain were correlated with the defects they produced in performance of movements ; the poising of an	arm	, for instance , to carry out an operation with the fingers could be dissociated from the ability to use the fingers skilfully . These studies continued ,  with increasing sophistication ,  after his return to Europe in 1966 as Professor of Anatomy at the new Erasmus University in Rotterdam .  He showed that injury to connections within the cerebral cortex could cause the dissociation of hand movements guided by vision from those guided by touch .	None

To carry out a wholesale purge of the party apparatus ,  Mao appointed Chen as head of the Cultural Revolution Group ,  a kitchen cabinet of loyal disciples ,  including Mao 's  wife Jiang Qing ,  that was to lead the assault on the party hierarchy .

As dawn broke yesterday , the same group , this time led by a mother with a baby in	arms	, faced down the police patrols and reached the embassy successfully . On Sunday West Germany had complained about the police presence around its embassy ,  and the slackening of restrictions is thought to have reflected an apparent Czechoslovak desire to remain as far as possible on good terms with both Germanies .

When there is nothing above your head but the bracing T - bar  fitted as much to provide body rigidity as to anticipate US safety regulations that did not materialise  so much the better .  From February 1973 , all Stags were sold with both hood ( which stows neatly in a lidded well behind the back seats ) and hardtop ( which required two pairs of strong	arms	to manipulate ) . So heavy and cumbersome is the hardtop ,  which fails to turn the Stag into a refined fixed - head coupe because of atrocious wind whoosh ,  that many have succumbed to rust while lying neglected in the garden ,  incubating snails .  The Stag is not a sports car ,  nor is it especially fast :  any modern GTi hatchback will comfortably outpace it in a sprint from rest to 60mph .	None

Indeed during the finale , at the rate his	arm	whirled over his Fender strings , it looked as though he had caught the tail end of Hurricane Hugo during their US tour . Roger Daltrey ,  all Shirley Temple curls and inflated biceps ,  swung his microphone dutifully and John Entwistle ,  in a tatty spiv 's  blouson and shock of white hair ,  stood characteristically immobile ,  but it was Townshend who looked most chirpy .

The cause for GM 's  concern is plain when one realises that its West European operations have emerged as the biggest profit earners in the entire group ,  accounting for some 37.3 per cent of net income in the last two years but for only 14.6 per cent of group turnover .  Not least among its star performers has been the British	arm	, Vauxhall , which last year achieved record net profits of 152m and record car sales .

The bishops '  caution came after 2,500 Basques marched through San Sebastian on Saturday protesting against ETA 's  killing of a police officer ,  Jose Angel Alvarez ,  father of six .  The bishops claimed that a vote for Herri Batasuna in the 29 October general election was incompatible with one 's  moral and Christian conscience .	None

459	arm	5	THE City is braced for further nervous trading in both currencies and shares this week but most analysts expect interest rates to stay at 15 per cent despite yesterday 's  slump in the value of the pound .  As the pound slid through the important benchmark of DM3 to close at DM2.9737 and lost ground against the dollar ,  most analysts agreed that the Chancellor would resist a further hike in interest rates at least for the duration of the Conservative Party conference ,  and possibly for some weeks to come .  A typical comment came from Bob Semple of County NatWest , the stockbroking	arm	of National Westminster . I do n't think interest rates will go up again .  The Chancellor has no option but to sit and wait ,  he said .	None
460	arm	1	Since the Vietnamese withdrawal ,  the two non - communist resistance factions  -  the Khmer Peoples National Liberation Front  ( KPNLF )  and the Sihanoukists  -  have mounted a big offensive with an even bigger publicity campaign to boost their credibility .  The Khmer Rouge has done nothing ,  because it has no need to prove anything .  Its	arms	supplies from China are assured . Speculation that its soldiers would attack the town of Pailin on the Thai border has died down ,  as it became clear that to hold Pailin would be more of a liability than an asset .  It would tie down a lot of troops and would also give Phnom Penh the opportunity to raise international alarm at the spectre of the return of the Khmer Rouge .	None
461	arm	1	The calculation is that increased pressure on Hun Sen will force him back to the negotiating table ,  ready to make the dreaded concession :  the inclusion of the Khmer Rouge in a political settlement .  The main supporters of the Khmer Rouge are the Chinese ,  who kept advisers in Phnom Penh throughout the Pol Pot era ,  and now supply the guerrillas with arms and money .  The Chinese want to put pressure on Vietnam , and Peking has made clear that it will continue sending	arms	until the Vietnamese - installed government of Hun Sen agrees to some form of power - sharing that includes the Khmer Rouge . The Khmer Rouge says it has changed ,  and now supports a free market economy and a multi - party system .  Given the conviction of Khmer Rouge members that they are the only people who can save Cambodia ,  few observers believe their commitment to multi - partyism would last for long .	None

There is a tragic buffoon with bald pate and flowing hair ; a short , bespectacled man entering a grey and paunchy middle age ; and Gallotta himself , who patters manically around the stage , fixing the dancers with an unfocused glare , while waving his	arms	and muttering instructions down a microphone . When Gallotta works up steam he has the dancers going through some startlingly slick paces  polished dance routines ,  split - second falls and lifts and a brisk formation crawl .

466	arm	5	I 've got a nasty feeling he may need to jack up interest rates further ,  but possibly not for very long .  The fall in London ,  most of which took place in the afternoon ,  was triggered by a combination of factors .  These included a pessimistic forecast from BZW , the stockbroking	arm	of Barclays Bank . In the BZW forecast ,  Peter Thomson said the FT - SE index should be back to 2,100 - 2,200 by the end of this month and would at best hold its own next year but more likely fall to 1,800 ,  where it started this year .  Mr Thomson also said the Government 's  aims of controlling inflation would put pressure on company profits and make a share prices surge in the winter/spring unlikely .	None

Lawyers acting for Ferranti concede that there is no chance of getting back the full 215m which the company is being forced to write off as a result of the International Signal and Control fraud .

Detectives are working on the theory that the bags had been there for some time .  If the IRA is involved , they may have been dumped after the discovery of an IRA bomb factory in Clapham , south London , last December , in which 150lb of Semtex ,	arms	and other equipment were discovered , with a list of 100 potential targets . Subsequently ,  22lb of Semtex was found dumped in water filter beds in Stoke Newington ,  north London ,  and then 25lb of Semtex and some firearms were found near Scarborough ,  North Yorkshire .

Mr Saatchi will continue as chairman but is being replaced as chief executive by Robert Louis - Dreyfus ,  a French citizen and president and chief executive of IMS International ,  who yesterday pledged to restore the strength of Saatchi  Saatchi 's  core business .  My first job is to learn Saatchi 's activities and to do a good job of selling the consulting businesses , he said , in a reference to the company 's previously announced plans to sell its management consultancy	arm	. I would hardly be joining a group if I felt it was about to be taken over .  The problem with Saatchi is cost containment .	None
471	arm	1	He advocated an approach of saying ,  Yes ,  but ,  rather than No ,  perhaps ,  in relation to the European Community .  For example ,  on the controversy over the removal of frontier controls ,  Britain 's  Commissioner proposed that controls should be replaced with police and Customs officer powers to check any traveller on suspicion of drugs or terrorist offences .  The Government has been resisting the removal of frontier controls because of anxieties about drugs and illicit	arms	traffickers . On the EMS ,  Sir Leon said that the Government 's  primary criterion for entry  - that of falling inflation  had already been met .  He strongly applauded the decision by Nigel Lawson ,  the Chancellor ,  to raise interest rates last week ,  and argued that a sharper rise of two percentage points might have been more immediately effective .

472	arm	4	Today England ,  having demolished a Railways XI containing no opposition of any note ,  take on a team sponsored by Air India ,  which looks almost as weak .  The locals field one former Test player ,  Madan Lal ,  and although Maninder Singh  last seen being swept to oblivion by Gooch in the Bombay World Cup semi - final  was practising at the England net yesterday ,  he has yet to come to terms with an attack of the yips .  It is a problem which seems curiously common to left -	arm	spinners , and manifests itself with the bowler either failing to release the ball , or propelling it vertically into the air . It finished  ( as a bowler )  the former Derbyshire player ,  Fred Swarbrook ,  who gave up the unequal struggle when ,  peering frantically around to see where a delivery had gone ,  he found out only when the ball dropped out of the stratosphere and hit him on top of the head .

477	arm	1	The Army ordered sentries to wear flak jackets and constructed many sandbagged emplacements ,  although most barracks were still protected by little more than chain link fences .  The IRA did not choose to attack again until March 1987 .  A possible reason is that it was difficult to get	arms	and ammunition to the right place , despite the virtual absence of border controls between Germany and its western neighbours . Communication with an active service unit  two to 10 terrorists  far from Ireland was a further obstacle .  Another reason could be that the IRA had become aware of British intelligence 's  drive for informers .	None

481	arm	1	With respect to the latter ,  for example ,  women are no longer excluded from night duty and they perform a wider range of section duties than before .  However ,  ordinary policewomen tend to feel that there are constraints upon equal opportunities within the force .  Some of these are official , in that senior managers do not allow policewomen to carry	arms	, from which follows some restrictions on where policewomen cam be stationed , and on their involvement in high - profile political policing , such as at riots . Most of the constraints ,  however ,  are informal .  With relatively so few policewomen ,  the occupational culture of the force is heavily masculine ,  and the wider cultural values that exist in Northern Ireland generally make men more conservative in their attitudes towards gender and sex roles .

488	atmosphere	1	A famous passage of art criticism can be cited as one example entirely beyond dispute .  The author spent much of his life as a bachelor Fellow of Brasenose College Oxford ;  his cloistered life was devoted to writing ,  notably on classical antiquity and the Italian Renaissance .  Walter Pater was a master of	atmosphere	; he had been inspired as a young man by Ruskin , and his idealism about art and his fine prose were in turn much admired by a younger generation of aesthetes , among whom Oscar Wilde was a prominent figure . One of Pater 's  subjects for a perceptive essay was Leonardo da Vinci ;  it gave special prominence to the painting now generally known as the Mona Lisa  .  The following critical passage comes from this piece ,  first published in the Fortnightly Review  in 1869 ,  and then in 1873 in Pater 's  book ,  Studies in the History of the Renaissance  .	None

Meyer Schapiro ,  who had a specialist concern with Romanesque art ,  was an open - minded historian of this sort .  He wrote enthusiastically about the later work of Arshile Gorky : Gorky 's	atmosphere	, veiling the hard opaque wall of the canvas , evokes a nocturnal void or the vague , unstable image - space of the day - dreaming mind .

Sometimes you will be directly addressed by the characters this is something which happened a great deal in Greek and Elizabethan theatre ( for example , look at the speech by Chorus in Act 4 , scene 1 of Henry V , which draws the audience into the	atmosphere	before a battle enormously effectively ) .

495	atmosphere	5	In fact ,  whereas the parallel protestant movement of evangelical revival was for all people ,  and the issue tended to be decisive ,  catholic spirituality diverged on both points .  The principal one was that conversion and growth were particularly directed at the clerical - religious lite ,  where the annual retreat system formed the annual or biennial centre of the individual spiritual life .  The retreat consisted , and still does , of anything from five to thirty days of spiritual exercises , usually in an	atmosphere	of silence and contemplation apart from listening to the preacher when there is one , but with additional features of both vocal and silent prayer . The laity had a pale reflection of this programme in the parish mission ,  designed to convert the laity or at least bring them back to regular church practices .  Morality was for the laity ,  whose life was dominated by the battle against mortal sin ,  and who therefore lived under the threat of hell and were always at risk .	None

The Victorian and Edwardian eras witnessed many wholesale rebuildings of modest Georgian drinking - houses ;  during the Interwar period even more money was pumped into enlarging and rebuilding old pubs ,  as well as in creating large new ones  ( see Alan Powers '  essay below )  .  However , alterations were more often than not effected with some degree of sympathy for the existing fabric and	atmosphere	. With the advent of postwar Modernism much of this sympathy evaporated .

500	atmosphere	1	A pub ,  like any other old building ,  is far more than just its principle facade ,  or its four walls .  As Neil Richardson noted in 1980 ,  An old town pub is not just an attractive Victorian or Georgian facade ,  it is a building which is still being used for the purpose for which it was built .  The design of interiors are as valid today as they were in earlier times the vaults , snugs , parlours , each with their own character , can still provide a pleasant , varied	atmosphere	. However ,  to public and professionals alike many old buildings are still regarded as representing little more than four external walls .  This even applies to listed buildings :  there is still a worryingly widespread general belief that listing only covers the facade ,  or perhaps just the exterior ,  whereas it is of course expressly designed to protect the whole  building .	None
501	atmosphere	5	This is especially true of those pubs now targeted by the breweries as centres for family eating .  A traditional interior does not have to be incompatible with accommodating whole families ,  nor with providing meals ;  yet an increasing number of old pub interiors are being sacrificed on the altar of the identikit eating house  whether the brewer 's  concept be a downmarket steakhouse or part of a family restaurant chain masquerading as an independent local concern .  Many of the interiors created by the designers of such facilities are as forbidding as the old - fashioned spit - and - sawdust pub ; any lingering	atmosphere	is swept away in a barrage of stained wood and fake Victoriana , and any casual visitors made to feel inordinately guilty if they do not , alas , wish to eat . The subjugation of individual character in such cases  which on occasion even involves the removal of all traces of the pub 's  actual name  is particularly depressing .  The aim of this report is not to demand that brewers turn the block back to 1620 ,  1720 ,  1820 or even to 1920 ;  pubs have to make money ,  and have to adapt to some extent to changing needs and expectations .	None
502	atmosphere	1	Much needs to be done .  The multi - roomed and historically - eclectic pub needs to be protected against the ravages of the all - over designer look .  As has been frequently pointed out , it is no use providing excellent beer or food if the pub in question has lost all of its charm and	atmosphere	; and surely a multi - roomed pub , with a number of differing environments , is the best way to serve what is after all always a very diverse and unstandardised community . In 1976 the Lord Chief Justice ,  dismissing Bass Charrington 's  appeal against a proposal to open up the interior at the Romans Hotel in Southwick ,  Sussex ,  declared that it might be undesirable in the public interest to see more public bars disappearing and more mergers of public and saloon bars of the kind in question here In addition ,  far better liaison needs to be established between the breweries and local authority Conservation and Planning Officers ,  English Heritage ,  the National Amenity Societies ,  local civic bodies and ,  of course ,  pub landlords and their clientele over planned pub refurbishments .

503	atmosphere	5	The Birmingham International Film and Television Festival enters its seventh year in 1991 acknowledged as an event of national and international importance .  The Festival also plays a role in the artistic renaissance of Birmingham ,  a profile confirmed by the continuing success of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra ,  under its Artistic Director ,  Simon Rattle ,  the recent move of both the Birmingham Royal Ballet  ( formerly Sadler 's  Wells Royal Ballet )  and the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company to Birmingham ,  the newly launched Towards The Millennium annual arts Festival and the Arts Council of Great Britain 's  invitation to Birmingham to launch Arts 2000 ,  as the UK City of Music in 1992 .

Firstly , karateka are not allowed to bring their own coaches with them to training sessions because experience has shown that the presence of other coaches breaks up the training	atmosphere	, and causes people to separate to far corners instead of remaining together . The second point is that you may be asked to take a drug test at any squad session .  If you refuse ,  you will be treated as though you had failed the test ,  and you will face a lifetime ban .	None

The hills themselves looked asleep ,  the heather glowed dust - blue in the hazy light ,  and the people ,  after a night of little sleep and hours of walking and standing ,  now looked stunned as they sat on the grassy banks ,  leaned on dykes ,  or lay on their backs in the hayfields ,  munching oatcakes and drinking the last of their water .

518	atmosphere	1	For every four windows on a Mark 3 standard - class coach there are four and a hf bays of seats ,  only the end bays matching the windows and succeeding bays being more tightly spaced so that some passengers are seated against a blank wall .  But in riding ,  quietness ,  and general environment ,  Mark 3 coaches gliding through the countryside at speed owe little to even a decade ago. Wall - to - wall carpeting , luggage racks running lengthways above the windows , supplemented by space for cases and bags between the seats , provide an uncluttered spaciousness to give a relaxed	atmosphere	on the longest of journeys . At least that is what it should be like .  The upsurge in traffic in the 1980s has alas meant that passengers have often had to stand in the centre aisles ,  in the lobbies ,  and around the door vestibules .	None
519	atmosphere	1	But this will be to no avail if the choreographer is attempting to tell a story and does not have expert advice from musicians of the calibre of Edwin Evans ,  Constant Lambert   and John Lanchbery .  All made valuable scores from existing music for de Valois ,  Ashton and MacMillan .  Not all the results were of the same high quality ; nevertheless the music they arranged reinforced the choreographer 's design by giving the plot	atmosphere	, local colour , continuity and flow as well as giving the dancing its rhythmic vitality , emotion and mood . In some cases it also helped to underline the main moments in the action by emphasising gestures for greater strength and expression .  In other cases they added humour ,  most notably in Lanchbery 's  score for La Fille Mal Garde  ,  where several witty slants in the orchestration raise laughter ,  for example the music for the Cock and the Hens .	None
520	atmosphere	1	It is in contrast to another leitmotif that marks the entrances of Carabosse ,  the wicked fairy .  The two tunes underline the conflict between good and evil .  Whereas Adam and Prokofiev 's leitmotifs heighten the emotional content of the love theme , Tchaikovsky 's are there to create the right	atmosphere	and to emphasise the conflict . When Stravinsky composed The Firebird  he used leitmotifs in yet another way .  He created very distinctive passages of ascending chords to accompany the magic bird 's  flight through the trees .	None
521	atmosphere	1	Manner of moving the body as in walking ,  running ,  dancing ,  etc. If choreographers are to justify their reasons for creating a ballet ,  they should use or create a style of movement appropriate to and expressive of the characters in the story being told and their moods ,  emotions and actions .  The dancers or players in a theme ballet will need to convey the general	atmosphere	and any other element pertinent to the situation in which they find themselves , as well as the mood and content of the music chosen to give them phrasing . They will need to do the same if they are interpreting music .  Today there are many ballets which are created in the generally accepted styles from which choreographers can borrow :  classical ,  demi - caractre  ,  romantic ,  character and/or national ,  and modern  ( see pages 75138 )  .	None
522	atmosphere	1	( See also page 41 .  )  Rhythm in ballet is not therefore a mere time - keeper as it is in such social ballroom dances as waltzes and fox - trots .  A ballet fur the stage must have an overall rhythm which sets the	atmosphere	, quality , mood and possibly the emotional content of the whole . And ballet must also have short phrase rhythms which will give it variety ,  dimension ,  mass ,  structure ,  texture and style .  Perhaps no ballet has ever made the same impact on dancers and audience as Stravinsky 's  Rite of Spring  .	None
523	atmosphere	1	3 Once an outline of the story and a general layout of the plot have been decided ,  they should be discussed with the composer or arranger of music whose first task may be to create a proper beginning with the overture .  Is it to set the general	atmosphere	and mood as Stravinsky did for The Firebird Mysterious sounds of the wind whispering in the trees , the soaring flight of a bird and the heavy tread of an unseen foot are still a wonderful introduction to this magic tale . On the other hand ,  Prokofiev used his overture to Romeo and Juliet  to introduce the leitmotifs which will help both dancers and audience to follow the unfolding of the plot .  He contrasts the love themes of Romeo and Juliet with those which accompany the bitter struggles and fights between Montague and Capulet .	None
524	atmosphere	5	Despite the general activities there is menace in the air and it is not long before the rival factions of Montagues and Capulets are fighting and deaths occurring before the lovers even meet .  This opening is very different from the quietly charming first scene of A Month in the Country  ,  where the only thing amiss is Natalia 's  bored behaviour .  Even with such examples in mind the choreographer may well decide it is better to delay the confrontation between the chief players because , by creating and stressing the general	atmosphere	, this raises the audience 's expectations before the meeting of the protagonists , and the sudden onset of passion is what makes the ultimate tragedy so poignant . This happens in Giselle  where Hilarion 's  suspicions of Albrecht 's  identity are already aroused before Albrecht meets Giselle .  Hilarion 's  discovery of Albrecht 's  sword and later his confrontation with Giselle ,  with the sword in his hands ,  still does not convince Giselle of Albrecht 's  duplicity .	None

None
526	atmosphere	1	They are also part of certain styles of Indian dance where gestures are explicit in conveying the beauty of the world ,  of women and of  -  love .  In such dances physical contact between lovers rarely if ever takes place .  Ashton broke this all - but - written law and communicated the exotic	atmosphere	of the dream but there was little to express the passion of love , which he would later convey in such works as A Month in the Country . Chinese  The most interesting of present - day ballets inspired by oriental sources is MacMillan 's  Song of the Earth   ( music by Mahler )  .	None
527	atmosphere	1	Even such mundane tasks as eating or drinking have found a place in some ballets .  Because on the stage they acquire importance ,  they must be seen to have a proper purpose .  This is usually to throw light on the character being played or to create the right	atmosphere	for the location of the action and for the expressive action required for the unfolding of the plot or theme . The Concert  Robbins '  view of concert - goers .  The Listeners  ( The Royal Ballet )	None
528	atmosphere	1	The events and circumstances surrounding such plots are difficult to control and organise because the characters are supposedly living in the real world .  So the choreographer cannot make strong contrasts between the style usually used for the other - worldly spirits and that used for the characters living in the particular setting .  He can only highlight the	atmosphere	supporting the plot , especially those circumstances where he has to portray differences between classes and thus general behaviour , idiosyncrasies , etc. , for example the contrast that must be made between the dances for all and sundry in the town square and those for the aristocrats in the ballroom of Romeo and Juliet . Nevertheless every choreographer creating this kind of romantic ballet today has to spend much time creating the proper gestures to replace the words ,  which in such ballets are never spoken but must be understood .  If the dancers perform those gestures with feeling and understanding they will express the moods ,  emotions and actions of the characters they play .	None
529	atmosphere	1	If the dancers perform those gestures with feeling and understanding they will express the moods ,  emotions and actions of the characters they play .  This is what happens in MacMillan 's  Romeo and Juliet  and Ashton 's  A Month in the Country  .  It is perhaps appropriate to stress again that where playwrights require pages of dialogue to explain every factor in the development of the plot , to create a changing	atmosphere	and to show how the actions affect the actors in the play , dancers can communicate whole passages of dialogue in a few expressive gestures woven into enchanements . ( As played by the Moscow Arts Theatre ,  Turgenev 's  A Month in the  Country  takes over two hours ,  Ashton 's  ballet roughly half an hour .  )  Only characters and episodes essential to the plot are retained .	None
530	atmosphere	1	Massine 's  brilliant use of descriptive and narrative gestures in The Three - Cornered  Hat  was a proper development of Fokine 's  mimed dance and danced mime ,  first seen in The Firebird  and Petrushka  .  As already noted ,  the dances Fokine staged for the nursemaids ,  coachmen and others at the Fair were real dances  ( see page 59 )  .  They created the	atmosphere	and mood , but the narrative was told by the dolls using specially created movements which could be called dances of character . Characters from the commedia dell'arte When Dauberval defined what he meant by dances of character he undoubtedly had in mind some easily recognised characters of the commedia dell'arte ,  whose actors regularly played such roles as the absent - minded doctor or scientist ,  miser ,  termagant wife or widow and various clowns such as the sad Pierrot or zany clown .	None
531	atmosphere	1	Yet this work was absolutely contemporary when produced .  The three boys come directly from a battleship when they pick up three girls from the street .  The dancing reflects the wartime	atmosphere	when shore leave was a cherished moment . Even though the boys and girls are figments of Robbins '  imagination ,  their brief encounter is based in reality even to the introduction of popular dance steps and stylistic elements current during the 193945 war .  Both the above - mentioned works show that ballets based on the life of real people require that choreographers closely observe the characteristics and idiosyncrasies of all types of person and that they make them recognisable in order that they convey meaning .	None
532	atmosphere	1	The group activities ensure that each phase of the ceremony is performed according to tradition .  The design emphasises the importance of creating a style which will define not only the time ,  place and action ,  but also the characters portrayed .  The technical or general style creates the structure and	atmosphere	of the whole . In other words ,  the particular becomes the general .  A similar analysis could be made of MacMillan 's  Requiem  .	None
533	atmosphere	5	It is the very particular choreographic style that MacMillan created for the child - like figure in Requiem  that emphasises more strongly than any other of today 's  ballets the need for choreographers to explore dance itself .  Only when they have examined what hands ,  arms ,  legs and feet ,  body and above all the head can do in isolation and then in harmony with the story ,  theme or music ,  can they set out and create a style which will be general in structure and particular in texture ,  with the right quality ,  mood ,  emotion ,  action and character .  The structure will determine the lines and shapes needed to fill the dimensions and , when needed , help to create the	atmosphere	and mood of the whole . Choreographers must then decide how many and which details they need to add to disclose the particular features of the story ,  theme and/or music that they wish to communicate .  The exploration of what each part of the body can express in isolation and then in co - ordination with the rest is possibly the most important aspect of a choreographer 's  work if it seeks to be modern in spirit and technique .	None
534	atmosphere	5	While we must support family rooms in those pubs which have the space and can provide suitable amusement for the little angels ,  this cannot remain the only answer to the problem .  Family rooms are useful to let the less well - behaved and noisier children run riot but they are frequently cold and characterless and ,  no matter how good the facilities may be ,  you often feel excluded from the main atmosphere of the pub .  I WOULD rather take my children into the main bar or lounge of a pub and expect them to sit sensibly and reasonably quietly so that we can all relax , drink , talk and eat in a proper pub	atmosphere	. What is needed is a relaxation of the law as it now stands to allow the controlled admission of children to certain pubs at certain times of day .  I am not proposing a free - for - all ,  but the admission of children to certain pubs on the application of the licensee and the approval of the local licensing bench .	None

536	atmosphere	2	Non - corpuscular radiation is in the form of high energy X rays which ,  assuming that the earth is in the path of the rays ,  will reach the earth in fifteen minutes .  This radiation may increase the depth of the D layer due to ionisation and produce the all too well known Dellinger face out when long - distance HF communication ceases abruptly .  Corpuscular or particulate radiation appears in the form of protons and neutrons which take longer to reach the earth 's upper	atmosphere	than the higher energy radiations . These nuclear particles arrive at the F1 and F2 layers approximately 48 hours following a solar event and produce ionisation by colliding with gaseous molecules and cosmic particles .  This explains why so few protons are detectible at the earth 's  surface except after very major events .	None

If the	atmosphere	were not so charming , it would be less of a temptation . In postwar Britain ,  the clothes ,  accents ,  and diction of the siblings may have changed ,  but ,  so far as I can judge ,  the suffocating insular coziness is just the same .

Before Agincourt ,  the French tents are well - appointed ,  and the mood is impatient ,  while the English soldiers huddle fatalistically under a hostile sky .	None
548	atmosphere	1	Cherney said  ( in the only programme - note )  that he had been inspired by Golani 's  bearing as well as her playing ,  and although the density of events was not high ,  the sense of concentration and unity between music and performer was total as the wilder elements were gradually exorcised and a numb calm remained .  Prousse ,  by Jean Papineau - Couture ,  argued an intense and clearly delineated course from climax to climax :  the most powerful of the evening 's  compositions ,  and the one most likely to attract other players .  These were both composers of the middle generation , known quantities by name at least , like Michael Colgrass whose Variations for Viola and Percussion ended the official programme in Bartok - and - Brittenish style , unfortunately with a built - in wrecking device for its own	atmosphere	: the drums must constantly be retuned . Robin Engelman ,  who coped patiently with the percussion part here ,  had a marginally less exciting time in Bruce Mather 's  Gatinara ,  where easy - going alternations of viola and marimba once took off in a bout of vigorous hocketing ,  but not for long .  Messages IV suggested greater youth in its composer ,  Stephen Tittle ,  who used a sort of minimalism with interruptions to build up a spirited and engaging little number ,  though hardly one to overstretch the skills of Bob Becker ,  the percussionist this time .

549	atmosphere	2	And the actresses themselves are a delight :  Josette Bushell - Mingo has an extraordinarily mobile face and an infectiously comic manner ,  Joy Richardson shows an uncanny ability to get inside a 10 - year - old 's  skin ,  and Angela Bruce ,  as the mother ,  has natural authority .  The rape scene takes place with breathtaking violence ,  the fair exudes riotous conviviality ,  and the Brer Rabbit japes come over with gusto .  The accents are entirely convincing and the authentically Southern	atmosphere	implies an ever - present threat from white oppressors lying in wait beyond the cosiness of the backyard palisade . By the interval ,  though ,  the show already felt overlong ;  as Act Two ground into heavily didactic gear the procession of events seemed interminable .

553	atmosphere	5	But it is surely silly to deny that it has thrown politicians and television journalists together in an association that remains totally invisible to the public .  In fact ,  thanks largely to Sir Robin Day  the Grand Inquisitor ,  as he calls himself in the title of his new book  the impression that the average viewer probably has of politics on television is that it is predominantly adversarial .  That may still be true of the set - piece studio interview though even there the prior indication of lines of questioning is by no means unknown ( and the viewer would probably be astonished at the general closeness of the	atmosphere	that prevails in the green room afterwards ) . Of course ,  television is a performing trade  and the very element of show business involved for both the interrogator and the victim was bound to have its effect on what Lord Beaverbrook used to proclaim as the armed frontier between politics and journalism .  Like a lot of Lord Beaverbrook 's  phrases ,  that was probably more colourful than accurate  but if such a frontier ever existed then the imperatives of current affairs television have certainly modified and adjusted it .

555	atmosphere	5	DANCE / Court in a trap :  Judith Mackrell reviews Ashley Page 's  Piano at The Royal Opera House By JUDITH MACKRELL ONE of the great achievements of Ashley Page 's new ballet , Piano , is its creation of an elusive but powerful	atmosphere	that completely over - rides its lack of plot . Without over - stating the case Piano recalls some of Ashton 's  work in the rich allusiveness of its world ,  mysteriously intimating other ballets ,  other stages and other lives .  The ballet is set to Beethoven 's  First Piano Concerto and Page and his designer ,  Howard Hodgkin ,  have responded to the formality and intimacy that they find in the score by conjuring a kind of post - modern Court .

The last time I played there , for Nantes , there was very little	atmosphere	, and on Wednesday the Scots fans will be right behind us .

Likewise ,  aesthetically lacquered trappings dramatically impede the movements of the drama 's  main characters .  Taking two contrasting stories of thwarted aspirations from Chikamatsu , Akimoto 's play juxtaposes to evoke the	atmosphere	of popular melodrama - high - flown sentiment and down - to - earth sense .

565	atmosphere	5	But the arts media circuit is nothing if not socially cohesive .  If everybody knows everybody else and they all go to the same parties ,  then there is bound to be a certain unanimity ,  if not in their judgements at least in their objects of attention .  This is an almost inevitable function of the clubby	atmosphere	of the media in what is , after all , a very small country . I think it is an American character in one of Paul Theroux 's  short stories who says of England ,  This is n't a country ,  it 's  an interesting room .

566	atmosphere	1	It also has something to do ,  I am sorry to say ,  with intellectual laziness .  If something or somebody seems to be all the go ,  it takes a determined editor to ignore it even if he thinks it wildly over - rated .  The incestuous	atmosphere	of media discourse is exacerbated too by British xenophobia .

568	atmosphere	1	The churchmen were less buoyant ,  having presented Mr de Klerk with a memorandum in which they listed six steps he had to take immediately before negotiations about the government 's  much - vaunted new political dispensation could start .  Archbishop Tutu said in a news conference after the meeting that he was concerned about Mr de Klerk 's  failure to give any specific undertakings .  However , no doubt mollified both by the President 's dramatic decision on Tuesday to announce the release of eight long - term political prisoners and by the urbanity of his style , the archbishop did note that the talks had proceeded in a far better	atmosphere	than previous encounters he has had with the government . Appearing to agree in part with Mr de Klerk 's  assessment of the meeting ,  the churchmen said they saw their role as facilitators to get negotiation going .  The six steps proposed by this celebrated trinity of black anti - apartheid leaders were :  lifting the state of emergency ;  lifting political restrictions on individuals ;  releasing all those detained without trial ;  unbanning political organisations ;  releasing all political prisoners ;  reprieving all those sentenced to death .

A former editor of Izvestia , who was at the Central Committee plenum of 1964 which accepted the resignation of his father - in - law on the grounds of age and health , Mr Adzhubey is perfectly placed to recall the stifling	atmosphere	in the Politburo court at the time .

572	atmosphere	1	But despite its bland style ,  it hides a time bomb for Britain ,  for the reports are on southern Africa .  British officials say they believe this conference will not be obsessed with South Africa ,  as previous meetings have been .  The election of FW de Klerk as president is a sign of progress , they say , and the imminent release of Walter Sisulu and the apparent movement towards negotiations are signs of a new	atmosphere	. Britain wants to encourage movement ,  not to stifle it ,  and any talk of sanctions would be bound to have a bad effect .  Yet even the British acknowledge that there are individuals and countries wedded to sanctions ,  and according to Commonwealth officials ,  Britain may well again find itself in a minority of one when the subject is debated .

David Roper , marketing executive , said : Car exhaust emissions are a major source of lead pollution in the	atmosphere	, which can have long term effects to health , particularly young children . A recent RAC survey showed that nearly six out of 10 car owners do n't know if their car can run on lead - free fuel .

With the South American championship trophy on the sideboard and the side safely through to next summer 's  World Cup finals ,  it would seem that the Lazaroni system has worked pretty well so far .  Against Italy , Lazaroni is keen to experience a foretaste of the	atmosphere	that he and his side can expect next summer . Key figures in the new - look Brazilian team are the goalkeeper ,  Taffarel ,  the libero ,  Galvao ,  the midfield ball winners ,  Dunga and Alemao ,  and the strikers ,  Bebeto and ,  of course ,  Careca .

575	atmosphere	5	Roslavl ' officials would have lain quieter in  their beds at night if they had bothered to read Maxim Gorky 's  book On the Russian Peasantry  published that same year .  He pointed out that peasant opposition to government did exist ,  but on account of Russia 's  huge distances it expressed itself more by evasion than through open fighting .  This psychology naturally lingered on into the supposedly liberal	atmosphere	of NEP in the form of the utopian hope that obligations imposed from the Centre , as the peasants put it , could be avoided , whilst retaining economic rights . At the end of the winter of 19212 a cautious directive went out from Roslavl ' Party headquarters to all local head collectors of the tax in kind .  They were not to put undue pressure on the peasants themselves ,  but only on their fellow subordinate collectors .	None
576	atmosphere	5	One kolkhoz further to the north - east of Smolensk exchanged potatoes for farm machinery ,  whilst another shef factory that manufactured spare parts for linen plants gave iron to a local kolkhoz on its visits .  It insisted on calling a separate meeting for the kolkhoz women ,  so as to persuade them of their independence from their menfolk .  An undated set of questionnaires in the 1922 file for the Roslavl ' area reveals the prickly	atmosphere	that prevailed between the busybodies from the towns , as the rustics perceived them , and the primitive mores of the rustics themselves . When asked if their shefi acted in too authoritarian a manner ,  some kolkhozniki at first said it was very rare ,  but then in peasant  fashion slowly warmed up to the fact that they had been very angered by some young students who had written in Rabochii put  that their horses were badly fed and cleaned ,  and that they had not sown enough crops .  The arrogance of Bolshevik - inspired youth towards the patriarchal rural community also transpires from other criticisms directed against younger visitors .	None

In the Cabinet , Callaghan 's open methods and refusal to countenance conspiracies made for a more harmonious	atmosphere	than ever prevailed under Harold Wilson ( now Lord Wilson of Rievaulx ) .

With the mounting  balance - of - payments crisis ,  the TUC was reluctantly persuaded in the summer of 1976 to renew a virtual wage - freeze policy with a limit of 5 per cent increases for the next twelve months .  The financial	atmosphere	was dire at this period . Even so ,  the new relationship between government and the unions was unlikely to last ,  at least on the present basis .

581	atmosphere	5	The Principal Architect of the CWGC ,  Sir Edward Maufe ,  conceived the design of the Runnymede memorial .  He was deternined to use the dramatic location and its views to make a powerful memorial rather than to build a lofty edifice that would dominate the skyline .  His objective was to create an	atmosphere	of quiet and intimacy , so he made a garden , then a cloister and a shrine . The cloister includes panels that list the names of 20,435 airmen ,  grouped according to the year of death .  The structure is in Portland stone with Westmoreland green slate roofs ,  while the Shrine itself is a square tower that is ,  coincidentally ,  slightly reminiscent of an airfield control tower .

If the doctrine of collective responsibility can never quite be forgotten or discarded , at least it weighs most lightly on the wearer in the bracing , not to say rarefied , intellectual	atmosphere	of the CPC . Therefore I do not see why tonight I might not occasionally ,  if the argument should lead that way ,  be guilty of saying in office some of the things which I have said out of office .  The Plowden Report on Control of Public Expenditure  contained ,  amongst other nuggets of wisdom ,  the following sentence which I should like to take as my starting - point :  The social changes of the last fifteen years have altered the incidence of hardship ,  so that there now may well be excessive social services for some purposes and inadequate ones for others .

The Recessional  of 1897 was not the hymn of a nation strong in its own security .  In the 1890s the	atmosphere	was not of that settled calm with which it was credited by later and even more anxious generations . However confident the mass of the population may have felt in the durability of Britain 's  world role ,  those who ruled in Britain knew full well the kind of dangers the country faced and the need to take steps to meet them It would need a profound belief in providence to make one refrain from wondering why a group of foggy islands off Europe 's  north - western shores ,  populated beyond the means of subsistence that the islands could provide ,  endowed with no great natural assets outside the coalfields ,  should have become both the centre of a world empire and a possible arbiter of European rivalries .

Harley Street was also the business premises of some of London 's  leading psychoanalysts .  Writing about the novel in 1 927 , Eliot stated that nearly every contemporary novel known to me is either directly affected by a study of psycho - analysis , or affected by the	atmosphere	created by psycho - analysis , or inspired by a desire to escape from psycho - analysis Eliot emphasized the dangers of this and drew attention to the importance of the Jamesian stress on the whole deep mystery of man 's  soul and conscience .  But there seems little doubt that the psychoanalysts '  stress on the childhood roots of adult problems played its part in the general investigation of primitive roots which fills Sweeney Agonistes  .

Her frequent denunciations of high levels of taxation and public expenditure ,  of big government ,  and of the diminution of individual freedom and choice are passionate and deeply felt ;  they are expressed in attacks on the baneful ,  almost immoral ,  effects of inflation and of governments which debase the currency ,  or borrow rather than balance their income and expenditure .

Mrs Thatcher 's  style certainly contributed to the Cabinet divisions between 1979 and 1981 and again after 1987 .  She has strong views on most issues and her propensity to express her views boldly at the outset of a Cabinet discussion , combined with a sometimes dismissive attitude towards opposing colleagues , tended to change the	atmosphere	and polarize Cabinet discussions . This contrasted with the approach of some other Prime Ministers .  Attlee ,  Macmillan ,  Wilson ,  and Callaghan often waited for a policy line in Cabinet discussion to emerge before committing themselves .	None

He stayed in digs in a colliery village at the time and found it equally possible to integrate easily into the local community .  He detected no	atmosphere	of them and us , though he suspects that in similar circumstances today it might be a different story . He had been promised that once he had obtained his colliery manager 's  certificate ,  he would be made an assistant manager .  He received his certificate in July 1947 but the British coal industry had been nationalised in January of that year and his new bosses told him that in the changed circumstances they would not be able to carry out the undertaking he had been given .

597	atmosphere	5	Malawi has not been debilitated by localism ,  and experienced considerable economic growth in the 1960s and 1970s with a strong agricultural performance and an unusually effective civil service .  The economic problems experienced in the 1980s are largely due to the destabilizing impact of the civil war in Mozambique .  Nonetheless , the authoritarian nature of the regime has won it many enemies both inside and outside the country , creating an	atmosphere	of suspicion and intrigue amongst the educated elite . Furthermore ,  there is no sign that Dr Banda will be able to engineer a smooth and lasting transition to a leader with widespread popular support ,  and he thus endangers the achievements of his regime .  Malawi 's  experience illustrates fundamental problems in the complex interweaving of traditional and modern values which coexist in Africa .	None
598	atmosphere	5	In 1982 the presidency was constitutionally assumed by Biya who continued his drive to modernize the economy .  However ,  by mid 1983 Ahidjo evidently regretted his decision and sought to exercise control ,  partly from Monaco ,  over the government from his position as party chairman .  The subsequent tension between the two men created an	atmosphere	in which there were two attempted coups in 1983 , both emanating from sections of the army loyal to Ahidjo . By the end of the year ,  Biya felt strong enough to force a showdown with Ahidjo and the latter lost the position of party chairman while still abroad .  Ahidjo did not subsequently return to Cameroun ,  and in the presidential election of January 1984 Biya received a yes vote of over 90 per cent ,  which most Camerounians considered to be a genuine indication of his underlying support .

599	atmosphere	5	The civil servants '  reluctance would be resolved by a ministerial directive that the project must be supported  some action was always better than none ,  the project would have an impact in several regions ,  if it worked it would boost exports and create employment .  The snag lay in the price of meat ,  the Bank wanting it raised to choke off local demand and free meat for export ,  the government wanting it held at its current low level to keep urban meat - eaters happy .  Having flagged the issue and fired the interest of the minister , the Bank duo returned to the cooler , more workman - like	atmosphere	of life in Nairobi almost certain that sooner or later a project would go to the Bank board , and that it would almost certainly be approved . In fact it took another two years for the project to be fully studied ,  for the government to support its formal submission to the World Bank ,  for the Bank 's  board to approve it and for the first tranche of funds to flow .  The project was highly imaginative ,  building on a commercial ranching project which already existed .	None
600	atmosphere	1	Despite its usefulness as an introduction to the subject ,  it does ,  however ,  judiciously avoid overt criticism of its subject and devotes little analysis to the SI in its mature phase .  Nevertheless ,  Wollen presents a lucid account of the movement in its formative period and makes an interesting case for Andr Breton as a figure of some distinction in French intellectual history .  He also traces the Hegelian , and Lukcsian influences on leftist theories in France in the heightened intellectual	atmosphere	after the Liberation which provided the aesthetic and political context for the Situationists . Apart from Wollen 's  historical and theoretical essay ,  the other major contribution in the Boston text is Thomas Y. Levin 's  Dismantling the Spectacle :  The Cinema of Guy Debord .  This is again a comprehensive and thoroughly investigated article and is probably the first extended account of Situationist cinema in English .	None
601	atmosphere	5	It surfaces ,  bringing feelings of humiliation and chagrin and causing conflict in the family .  British society serves in fact to keep Izzat alive .  The contempt for Asian culture , the constant shadow of racial hostility and the disregard for family and group identity provide an	atmosphere	in which Izzat is constantly at risk and therefore is constantly charged and recharged . As a result the women suffer ;  they are made the scapegoats of damaged Izzat .  It is they ,  after all ,  who have always been the symbols of their culture and traditionally it is at their slightest touch that the delicate flower of Izzat can shrivel .	None

So what happens if a woman wishes to have her own identity and wear clothes which she alone has chosen   All too often the loving relationships turn bitter , the easy relaxed	atmosphere	around the subject of clothes becomes one of anger and outrage .

Other members of her family are also asked the same questions ,  and if there is the slightest discrepancy it can be used as proof that she is not the person she claims to be .  The women I spoke to who had been through the whole procedure told me of the many exhausting visits they had had to make to the British Embassies and High Commissions , of the	atmosphere	of contempt at these places , of the pettiness of the Entry Clearance Officers ( ECOs ) and interpreters , and the rude and unreasonable questions they had had to answer . They told me that sexual examination is a routine part of the entry certificate procedure at British Diplomatic missions in the Indian subcontinent .

The contribution made by these visitors to the	atmosphere	and overall success of the day is considerable for many of them , it is their first taste of the life now fully adopted by their sons , brothers and boyfriends who are now on parade . They are impressed at the speed and efficiency with which the spectacle unfolds .

A spore which lands on wood with a moisture content of 2025 per cent in a still and stuffy	atmosphere	where the temperature is between 7 and 27C ( 44 and 80F ) can germinate and then throw out hollow strands known as hyphae . These initially hair - like fibres seek out and feed off the cellulose in the wood which is digested by the fungus to leave a dry ,  desiccated and fragile shell of wood - fibre or lignin which ,  in the absence of the cementitious cellulose ,  cannot continue to perform any structural role required of the timber .  Having drawn the cellulose from one section of the wood ,  the hyphae reach on to adjacent sections of timber to continue the process ,  while the strands of the initial attack unite into an equally fast - spreading cotton - wool - like growth known as mycelium .	None
614	atmosphere	2	When this action is well established ,  the fungus will produce a sporophore ,  or fruiting body ,  which produces millions of spores .  The sporophore is at first a whitish - grey ,  unpleasant - looking fleshy growth and gradually becomes more leathery and dewy .  It bursts at internals to release into the	atmosphere	an enormous number of rusty - red spores which are carried on the breeze to germinate in distant damp timber , starting the process afresh . Dry rot exhibits an almost uncanny knowledge of the presence of timber and is able to thrust through brickwork mortar joints and to travel across brickwork behind plaster over great distances in its search for fresh food .  In this respect ,  it is quite capable of spreading from one building to another through a thick party wall .	None

618	atmosphere	2	Nicholas Luard of the John Muir Trust  ( husband of our cookery writer Elisabeth Luard )  has joined forces with local people to form the Bara Ceirch Conservation Group ,  named after the farm on which the conifer plantation is sited .  The group is only too aware that the dangers of conifer plantations are not limited to creating great black tracts of sterile land  ( nothing grows beneath their dense needles )  .  More worryingly insidious is their ability to act as magnets to acid rain , taking it from the	atmosphere	and releasing it into the soil , where it leaches down and enters the water system . Nicholas Luard and the other members of the group were particularly concerned about the planting of conifers at Bara Ceirch farm as it stands at the headwaters of the Rivers Cothi and Towy ,  two of the finest salmon rivers in Wales .  The plantation itself is close to a feeder stream that runs straight into the Cothi ,  as would acid taken in by the conifers .	None

This is because the deliberate burning of the rainforests pumps hundreds of millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide into the	atmosphere	. Carbon dioxide is the main cause of global warming  the Greenhouse Effect .

Hundreds of millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide are pumped into the	atmosphere	each year from tropical forest burning , contributing to the Greenhouse Effect or global warming which could severely disrupt the world 's climate .

624	atmosphere	5	Last year he was invited to hold an exhibition of his work at Urbino ,  in central Italy ,  at the house once owned by the Renaissance painter Raphael ,  which he had visited a few years before .  It was the first time that such an offer had ever been made ;  initially ,  he was loath to put his sketches on public display  but he was also flattered .  Finally , after some agonizing , he agreed on the grounds , as he wrote in the introduction to the catalogue , that I have a passion for Italy , her people , her countryside and the way in which art quite naturally seems to invade every aspect of life , thereby producing an	atmosphere	that is totally irresistible . He sent the paintings but none were for sale .  As he explained in Urbino ,  These sketches are very much a part of myself and I am sure those who paint themselves will understand how hard it is to part with something into which ,  when inspired ,  you have poured your heart and soul .

629	atmosphere	5	But this was in many ways a blessing .  Too  many studios had been built in Britain during the production boom and ,  at a time when filmmakers were anyway keener than they had been hitherto to get out among ordinary people ,  they found they were no longer constrained by anxious accountants determined to maximize the use of studio space .  Among those who found wartime location shooting refreshing was the actor Michael Redgrave who credited much of the quality in The Way to the Stars ( 1945 ) , Asquith 's atmospheric picture about life on an airforce base , to the	atmosphere	of those three weeks at Catterick , which could never have been created in the studio . Filmmakers were constricted as to subject matter by the requirement that their films contribute in some way to the war effort .  That was the deal to keep British filmmakers in business which Alexander Korda had proposed to government ,  and supported with his propaganda film ,  The Lion Has Wings   ( 1939 )  ,  combining documentary footage with patriotic clips from earlier feature films and a contemporary narrative full of pontifications on Britain 's  purpose in going to war .

The Gater Committee on Film Production Costs , which reported in October 1949 , was in no doubt that the film industry had brought its latest crisis down upon its own head , through creating a general	atmosphere	of extravagance and unreality , leading to a disregard of expense which would not be tolerated in other forms of business . Rank ,  however ,  argued with equal conviction that it was all the government 's  fault .  His case was not without foundation .	None
631	atmosphere	5	The UK government ,  following the example of the French and Italians ,  instituted measures to strengthen the ability of local producers to secure a reasonable return from the domestic box office ,  and filmmakers developed undemanding forms of cinema ,  mainly comedies and war films ,  that would reliably appeal to native audiences .  Meanwhile ,  cinema admissions declined steadily ,  from 1,365 million in 1951 to 501 million in 1961 ,  reinforcing the impression of limpness that hung around the whole of the British film industry .  The powerhouses of film production in the previous decade nearly all wilted in this	atmosphere	. Only Alexander Mackendrick at Ealing and David Lean seemed able ,  to some extent ,  to sustain their earlier initiatives ,  the one by focusing an acerbic eye on the state of England ,  the other by applying his extraordinary craftsmanship to such international films as The Bridge on the River Kwai   ( 1957 )  and Lawrence of Arabia   ( 1962 )  .

633	atmosphere	5	For Queen And Country  ( Sony )  is a tough and effective British urban western confronting racism and inner - city deprivation in uncomplacently stylised terms .  Representing a more traditional form of British cinema ,  John Schlesinger 's  Madame Sousatzka  ( Virgin )  has a stand - out performance by Shirley MacLaine and a keen eye for varied London locations ,  while A Time Of Destiny  ( Vestron )  is a baroque romantic melodrama from Gregory Nava  ( El Norte )  ,  which despite the miscasting of William Hurt as a Basque immigrant 's  son seemed to me to have been unfairly downgraded .  Another flawed but striking recent movie is DOA ( Buena Vista ) , an update from the creators of Max Headroom of the classic 1949 thriller of the same name , which may detrimentally alter the plot of the original but boasts nonetheless some arresting high - tech intimations of neo - expressionist	atmosphere	. Needing no alibis ,  however ,  though it comes close to an exploitation concept ,  is the hard - driving Australian movie Shame  ( Vestron )  ,  with a dynamic central performance by Deborra - Lee Furness as the city woman caught up in Outback violence .  Speaking of exploitation ,  students of the genre might care to consider Trapper County War  ( Guild )  ,  an archetypal example of the backwoods nightmare ,  set in one of those supposed hillbilly communities where the locals ,  when not spitting out tobacco or imprecations ,  are banding together to hunt down interlopers and blast them to bits .

Boldly ignoring the Shavian prescription ,  Nancy Meckler 's  highly original Shared Experience production of Heartbreak House at the Riverside Studios has the quality of a fragmented dream ,  only occasionally marred by a sock - it - to - em over - emphasis .  Written between 1913 and 1919 , Shaw 's masterpiece famously began with an	atmosphere	: that of cultured , leisured country - house England embracing the cataclysm of the first world war in a fevered death - wish .

Aura ,  a CBS recording made in Scandinavia four years ago  ( Davis went to WEA for his last two albums ,  after 30 years with Columbia )  ,  is as good a demonstration of that as anything the trumpeter has recorded since his most famous collaborations with Gil Evans .  It is an orchestral session featuring Danish musicians plus Davis ,  John McLaughlin on guitar ,  and Vince Wilburn on drums playing the Scandinavian trumpeter 's  Palle Mikkelborg 's  concerto for his hero ,  recorded in Copenhagen to accompany Miles 's  receipt of the Sonning Music Prize ,  a tribute whose earlier recipients have been Stravinsky ,  Leonard Bernstein ,  and Isaac Stern .

The Forum source said that the Communists may retain half the cabinet seats ,  but that this was the absolute maximum the party could expect .  It was clear that the longer the current unstable crisis	atmosphere	persists , the stronger the opposition 's bargaining position becomes . If its demands for a representative government are not met there is likely to be a general strike on Monday .

639	atmosphere	2	Two of the ERS instruments have been provided by the UK .  The Active Microwave Instrument radar system ,  built by Marconi Space Systems ,  is significant because it can be used over land or ocean :  it will return vital information about how the wind interacts with waves .  How the wind affects the ocean and modifies the heat exchanged with the	atmosphere	is not well understood , but is of paramount importance to weather forecasters who cannot wait for ERS - 1 to begin operations .

There are Americans who 'd give their eye teeth for this sort of data ,  says one ERS project scientist at the laboratory .  This greater accuracy will allow the heat transfer between the oceans and the	atmosphere	to be better computed . Commercially ,  the ATSR data will allow fishing vessels to home in on the edges of sea currents where fish congregate to feed on nutrients brought up from the ocean floor .

Nearly 10 per cent of the Earth 's  surface is covered by ice ,  which remains as terra incognita to climatologists as it was to 17th - century explorers .  Ice coverage limits the exchange of heat between the	atmosphere	and ocean , effectively insulating polar regions from sunlight during summertime .

Pro - reunification protestors dominated Leipzig 's  Karl Marx Square on Monday ,  shouting down other groups who spoke out for an independent and socialist East Germany .  These , in turn , screamed Nazis out in an	atmosphere	described by participants as explosive . There can be no doubt that the momentum in favour of German unity ,  as one state or a confederation ,  has been growing in East Germany .

His header ,  in injury time before the interval ,  brought a hardly deserved Cup exit for the 60 - a - week part - timers on a night when Gloucester proved there really was sporting life locally beyond Kingsholm .  This was the first time they had reached the second round and it was reflected in the	atmosphere	, though the official attendance of 3,877 , a record for the purpose - built Meadow Park ground , was hardly accurate . The kick - off was put off for 15 minutes because there were long queues outside .  According to the police at least 600 supporters had to be turned away for safety reasons .	None

653	audience	3	ARTISTS OWN WRITING Van Gogh is famous not only for his art ,  but for his writing .  He did not write an autobiography , but his letters have been a source of fascination to a wide	audience	, especially artists . Luckily ,  he had a correspondent in his brother Theo in whom he could confide and with whom he could explore ideas about art ;  the letters are thus an invaluable source of interpretation .  From the distance of a century ,  some of Van Gogh 's  enthusiastic appraisals of the art of his time look curious ;  but then ,  this artist acting as a critic was especially vulnerable to admiring art with a moral purpose ,  or work from which he was able to draw inspiration .

For other periods ,  historians are slowly making studies which document the connections of critics and historians with the markets .  In 1959 Dore Ashton was dismissed by the New York Times , the charges being that her articles were not aimed at a wide newspaper	audience	, and her articles on work by artist friends gave evidence of bias ( her husband , whose work she was forbidden to review , was a painter and print - maker called Adja Yunkers ) . John Canaday ,  the incoming editor of the newspaper 's  art page and responsible for the dismissal ,  had made a challenge to a climate of opinion in which Dore Ashton 's  criticism was valued for its sensitivity ,  and where the art which she praised was accepted .  Her supporters included Thomas Hess ,  Meyer Schapiro ,  Leo Steinberg ,  Harold Rosenberg ,  and Peter Selz ,  and their intervention ,  asserting that Canaday had offended Ashton 's  rights and responsibilities as a critic ,  resulted in Canaday 's  being censured by the American art critics '  association .

Although the scores of The Sleeping Beauty  and The  Nutcracker  followed Petipa 's  explicit orders that each item consisted of so many bars of one tempo and time signature and as to what it was supposed to represent ,  Tchaikovsky did demonstrate how ballet music could be developed symphonically by using the leitmotifs .  He showed how music could flow through a scene and not be broken up into short numbers which encouraged the	audience	to applaud each time . Stravinsky composed the first truly modern score for ballet with The Firebird   ( see page 61 )  .  He understood that there must be an overall rhythm as well as the phrase rhythms of particular leitmotifs and dances if dancers were to understand and feel properly Fokine 's  choreographic design .

680	audience	2	In the last example ,  the words form frivolous comment on the action .  But there is no such careful blending of ingredients in Tetley 's  Dances of Albion  where the singer 's  words of the traditional Lye Wake Dirge bore no relation to what was being danced on stage .  This was offensive to the Scots in the	audience	as was Tetley 's disregard for the purport of the poem by Blake that gave the ballet its title .

The music by Benjamin Britten includes some part of the War Requiem which means far more to British audiences than mere decorative patterning .  Choreographers have never disdained to use popular music for their everincreasing	audiences	and they realise that they should reflect popular taste . The score for La Fille Mal Garde   ( 1789 )  reflected the new revolutionary ideas pervading France and contained several folk and popular airs .  This example was followed by Gavin Gordon ,  singer - composer ,  who borrowed street songs and cries for his score of The Rake 's  Progress  .	None
682	audience	2	Ashton punctiliously followed the layout .  But Stravinsky 's  music ,  although classical in form ,  was far from the tuneful dance idioms of Tchaikovsky ,  Stravinsky 's  source of inspiration .  Despite strict rhythm and exact phrasing , the music was daringly frivolous in tone and quality because it was meant to entertain a popular	audience	. In following Stravinsky 's  guidelines ,  Ashton found many new ,  sometimes frivolous ,  ways of performing class - room steps .  The corps de ballet  neglect the turn - out and step forwards sur les pointes  ,  raising the working knee and resting the toe on the calf of the other leg ,  before moving forwards .	None
683	audience	2	This told how the poet ,  having taken opium ,  dreamt backwards through time to seek his love in a ballroom ,  on his way to a medieval scaffold ,  at a well in ancient Greece and finally at a Witches Sabbath ,  where her kiss ended in death  ( see page 56 )  .  However ,  Massine 's  interpretation of Brahms '  fourth Symphony  ( Choreartium  ,  1933 )  was very different .  It was the ideas behind this design that so interested not only the	audience	but also the music critics of the time ( see page 41 ) . Massine not only paralleled the overall and short phrase rhythms of the music by those of the dancers ,  but the instruments of the orchestra by related groups of dancers .  Each group was led by a soloist representing the leader of a particular orchestral section so that as the themes were taken up by first one and then another section ,  the various groups of dancers joined in .	None
684	audience	2	For example ,  when the musical phrases get complicated because of the use of many notes ,  the dancers find themselves using their hands feverishly in order to give every note its value .  Occasionally this can be interesting as it is in Bintley 's  Consort Lessons   ( 1984 )  .  But if it is repeated too often the incessant jigging of hands makes the	audience	restless , too . A study of Dalcroze Eurythmics from which such ideas emanate is valuable ,  but the practice must be used with discretion if the resultant ballet is not to resemble an examination of machinery rather than a feeling fur the rhythm and shape of the engine that makes the dancers perform .

685	audience	2	Instead of concentrating on the lines of the dance  which they will need if they ever dance in Ashton 's  Symphonic Variations  or Monotones  ,  MacMillan 's  Requiem  or Bintley 's  Consort Lessons   students spend more time loosening up to meet the demands of modern choreographers .  There is often a rush to create something new without enough thought being given to the physical problems they may cause .  There remain , however , a few dancers who excel in the purely classical roles , which an	audience	demands because they are still testing grounds for particular talents . Purely classical ballets are still popular ,  so there have to be choreographers who understand and mould the technique .  They must know how to make use of and when necessary discard the old conventional rules .	None
686	audience	2	takes place during a particular period and in a particular environment .  These two requirements were first established by Greek playwrights and were later codified by the Acadmie Franaise  ( 1635 )  when it laid down rules for the composition of any literary work .  The rules are still valid and the libretto of any ballet neglecting them often fails to hold the attention of its	audience	because the content has been weakened by too many irrelevances . Enigma Variations  Ashtons interpretation of Elgar 's  My friends pictured within '  ( The Royal Ballet )  A play must have a beginning  ,  a climax and an end  ( Aristotle )	None
687	audience	2	Most other story ballets can be analysed in much the same way .  Those with a theme ,  or which consist of dance only ,  have a similar plan .  A choreographer who neglects the old rules and any item pertinent to the unfolding of the plot , theme or music is demanding a great deal from an	audience	. Many plotless or so - called abstract ballets ,  by choreographers such as Balanchine ,  have no specific characters or climaxes but they do follow the composer 's  score very closely .  Most composers of specially commissioned music ,  even those later than Stravinsky ,  follow the time - honoured rules of thematic continuity and development and above all rhythmic phrasing .	None
688	audience	2	This can be effected by the use of a leitmotif or phrases of music .  Since the first performance of Giselle  ,  certain composers and arrangers have used leitmotifs fur one or several characters and repeat the leitmotifs each time the characters appear .  These musical phrases give continuity to the action and are most valuable because they help both performers and	audience	to understand how moments in the story or theme affect the players . Adolphe Adam ,  composer of the music for Giselle  ,  initiated this idea which greatly influenced Wagner and later composers .  Leitmotifs are a firm point of reference that carries the dancer onwards from the     beginning to the climax and to the end of the story .	None
689	audience	2	When petrushka is left alone in his room ,  his cries dominate the stage both musically and choreographically because the incessant throb is not heard .  So when the cry is heard again just before the curtain falls it comes as a final appeal for help .  There is always a moment of silence before the	audience	respond , so strong has been the tension . Prokofiev threaded two leitmotifs through his score for Cinderella  to mark the heroine and her Fairy Godmother .  When Ashton staged his version of the ballet he made Cinderella 's  leitmotif into a major factor fur the development of the plot by creating a matching dance leitmotif .	None
690	audience	2	Fokine was the first choreographer to distinguish the need for a particular style for each ballet when he created such different ballets as Les Sylphides ,  Le Carnaval  ,  Prince Igor ,  The Firebird  and Petrushka  .  From his innovations have come many developments opening the way for similar independently minded choreographers .  They also opened the eyes of the	audience	to the endless possibilities of expressing meaning through dance . Three particularly objective masters of choreography are de Valois in Job  and The Rake 's  Progress  ,  Massine with such different ballets as The Good   -  Humoured Ladies  and The Three - Cornered Hat  and MacMillan with Mayerling  and Requiem  .  A subjective view	None
691	audience	2	Choreographers can also take a more subjective view of their work .  This is equally important and has so proved throughout ballet history .  The choreographer seizes on the personality of a particular dancer and creates ballets through which the dancer gradually develops and discloses unique talent and qualities to such a degree that	audiences	soon recognise a star . The names of four choreographers immediately stand        out .  Taglioni recognised his daughter Marie 's  quality of other worldliness in La  Sylphide  ;  Perrot discovered Carlotta Grisi 's  unique qualities as an actress - dancer in Giselle  ;  Fokine exposed Tamara Karsavina 's  many - sided brilliance in such works as The Firebird ,  Le Carnaval  and Petrushka  ;  Ashton fostered Margot Fonteyn 's  varied personality .	None
692	audience	2	No better example can be given than by citing the careers of Tamara Karsavina and Margot Fonteyn ,  both of whom worked with many different choreographers as well as submitting themselves to the severely classical discipline of the older Petipa repertoire .  A general view  There is a third type of choreographer who produces ballets which give	audiences	great pleasure through the sheer variety of their virtuoso designs . Because of the interesting ,  usually technical ,  demands made on the performers ,  their ballets often become testing grounds for future soloists .  Variations from such ballets as Petipa 's  Don Quixote ,  Raymonda  and La Bayadre  and Bournonville 's  Napoli  are still considered by most classical dancers to be more technically demanding than the more complex twistings and turnings of modern choreographers who mix their styles .	None
693	audience	2	A ballet fur the stage must have an overall rhythm which sets the atmosphere ,  quality ,  mood and possibly the emotional content of the whole .  And ballet must also have short phrase rhythms which will give it variety ,  dimension ,  mass ,  structure ,  texture and style .  Perhaps no ballet has ever made the same impact on dancers and	audience	as Stravinsky 's Rite of Spring . Its urgent overall rhythm commands the choreographer to keep the dancers moving forever onwards with greater intensity to the climax ,  whilst the shorter phrase rhythms give the Chosen Maiden and smaller groups such ways of moving that they hold the audience 's  full attention until the fall of the curtain .  Variety	None

Variety  Being various ;  absence of monotony or uniformity ;  class of things differing in some common qualities from the rest of a larger class to which they belong	None
695	audience	2	Measurable extent of any kind ;  number of unknown qualities contained as factors in a whole Dimension immediately suggests that the choreographer must take into account the space in which the dancers move .  Although this is of considerable importance , particularly if the ballet is to be presented in a large theatre , too much concentration on certain of the dimensions ( height , depth or breadth ) may deprive some members of the	audience	of much of the pattern . for example ,  too much weaving and rolling of bodies on the floor is hardly visible from the stalls ,  whilst too much concentration on one side of the stage finds spectators on the same side craning their necks to see what is going on .  It was for such reason that most of Petipa 's  famous pas de deux  take place centre stage ,  whilst those of Ashton and MacMillan cover the whole area as befits their more flowing lyrical styles ,	None
696	audience	2	It must also refer to the depth of thought behind the design whether the subject deals with a bold tale or a subtle philosophical ,  psychological or even theological theme .  It may even present a comic ,  frivolous or bawdy joke to arouse laughter or attempt to reveal the workings of a composer 's  mind .  However , choreographers should always remember that whatever story , theme or music is chosen , it must be translated into clear , often simple , dance statements understandable by an	audience	. It should not be necessary to compile long programme notes ,  except perhaps in those cases where a poem is being interpreted  ( see page 28 )  .  Choreographers should never assume that all in the audience have sufficient knowledge of the subject ,  theme and ideas which are possibly understood only by an exclusive coterie of friends .	None

This does not mean that only wellknown or straightforward subjects and themes are to be staged .  far from it .	None
698	audience	2	Shakespeare 's  dramas of Hamlet ,  Romeo and Juliet  and Othello  have many subtle touches of humour and tenderness ,  as do his lighter works such as A Midsummer  Night 's  Dream  .  All have been translated into successful choreographic form .  Similarly the delicate and subtle nuances of such ballets as Ashton 's A Month in the Country , Robbins ' Dances at a Gathering and MacMillan 's Song of the Earth are successfully conveyed and capture the	audience	's attention from the moment the curtain rises by the impetus , rhythm , dimension and variety of dance . Dance in all its aspects has proved capable of embracing the whole range of emotions and behaviour that emerge from a proper reading and understanding of the text .  Mass	None
699	audience	2	Once an outline of the story and a general layout of the plot have been decided ,  they should be discussed with the composer or arranger of music whose first task may be to create a proper beginning with the overture .  Is it to set the general atmosphere and mood as Stravinsky did for The Firebird  Mysterious sounds of the wind whispering in the trees ,  the soaring flight of a bird and the heavy tread of an unseen foot are still a wonderful introduction to this magic tale .  On the other hand , Prokofiev used his overture to Romeo and Juliet to introduce the leitmotifs which will help both dancers and	audience	to follow the unfolding of the plot . He contrasts the love themes of Romeo and Juliet with those which accompany the bitter struggles and fights between Montague and Capulet .  Differently again ,  the overture to A Month in the Country  conveys romantic nostalgia with deeper hints of passion which Lanchbery created when he arranged little - known music by Chopin .	None
700	audience	2	Despite the general activities there is menace in the air and it is not long before the rival factions of Montagues and Capulets are fighting and deaths occurring before the lovers even meet .  This opening is very different from the quietly charming first scene of A Month in the Country  ,  where the only thing amiss is Natalia 's  bored behaviour .  Even with such examples in mind the choreographer may well decide it is better to delay the confrontation between the chief players because , by creating and stressing the general atmosphere , this raises the	audience	's expectations before the meeting of the protagonists , and the sudden onset of passion is what makes the ultimate tragedy so poignant . This happens in Giselle  where Hilarion 's  suspicions of Albrecht 's  identity are already aroused before Albrecht meets Giselle .  Hilarion 's  discovery of Albrecht 's  sword and later his confrontation with Giselle ,  with the sword in his hands ,  still does not convince Giselle of Albrecht 's  duplicity .	None
701	audience	2	Despite the great differences in style between the above three ballets and despite their different libretti the three choreographers perrot  ( with Saint - Georges )  ,  MacMillan and Ashton give valid reasons why the tragic deaths of Giselle ,  Romeo and Juliet ,  and Natalia 's  lost love are the inevitable result of what has gone before .  In other words ,  what happens at the beginning of the story states why the relationships between two or more characters lead to confrontations which continue onwards to a climax and finally draw the ballet to a suitable conclusion .  This last task is possibly the most difficult because the	audience	must be convinced that the ending chosen is the only possible outcome of everything that has gone before . The ending can also owe a great deal to the composer or arranger of music .  Stravinsky ensures a happy yet solemn ending to The Firebird  by using the old Easter hymn At the Gate where the whole congregation rejoices at the renewal of life .	None
702	audience	2	Texture  Arrangement of threads ;  the characteristic feel or look of this arrangement This definition should be understood as the choreographer 's ability to establish a style of movement through which the	audience	will feel and understand what the performers are communicating through a particular way of dancing . The style must disclose and be expressive of the moods ,  emotions and actions of the roles played even where few personal feelings are allowed to show ,  as in such ballets as Ashton 's  Monotones  where all that is needed is a calm ,  unhurried and seemingly endless weaving of the dance design in all its dimensions .  Nevertheless the three dancers in Monotones  are expressing their close relationship to each other and to the space in which they dance and above all to the flowing lines of the design and of the musical phrases .	None
703	audience	2	Or is he to allow her to rest her left forearm on his right and to guide her round in an elegant mazurka  leading her ,  as it were ,  from the shoulder so that she always moves just in front of him   Such beautiful manners are quite unlike those of the ranch hands and their girls in De Mille 's  Rodeo  or those in MacMillan 's  Elite Syncopations  .  In addition to the courtesy the partners show to each other , there are also the courtesies that must be shown to the bystanders on stage during a pas de deux so that such reciprocation can help to focus the	audience	's attention on the context of the dance . The courtesies must also be exchanged between couples in a group dance .  This is very important where there is a constant change of partners .	None
704	audience	2	It is equally important when she is wearing a soft tunic or one - piece tights and leotard .  The lines made by the two dancers together must always have room to breathe and to be seen separately if the whole design is to flow .  It is possibly the spaciousness of design that brings	audiences	again and again to Ashton 's Symphonic Variations and Monotones , whose straighter and continuously moving lines require the dancers to draw them calmly and to fill the stage generously with movement . This could not be more different from the cruel flinging of Mary Vetsera 's  body by Rudolf in the Mayerling pas de deux  with which MacMillan describes the Count 's  tragic mental state .  Technical characteristics	None
705	audience	2	A contradiction in style during this change of aulement  or alignment can distort the design .  Nevertheless an unusual change of aulement  or alignment can add interest and draw attention to a dancer 's  statement .  for example : the swift change from the grand dvelopp la seconde which Odile makes facing the	audience	and her sudden turn to arabesque when she looks straight into the kneeling Siegfried 's eyes in the Act II pas de deux of Swan Lake ; it is Odile 's triumph for she knows she has won Siegfried 's heart . Even more exciting changes of aulement  can be found in Ashton 's  Birthday  Offering  where each soloist dances an old step at a new angle ,  without breaking the rules or older conventions of nineteenth - century ballet .  He then gives an entirely new quality to the class - room exercise on which these enchanements  are based.	None
706	audience	2	Birthday Offering  Ashton 's  technical virtuosity  ( The Royal Ballet )  Choreographers who do not adhere strictly to the old conventions of court etiquette realise that their total design will flow more easily because their dancers '  behaviour will appear more spontaneous and natural .  For example : each soloist need not begin with a formal bow to a king or to the	audience	, nor end with another bow or considered pose ; but such behaviour may be included if the choreographer wishes to locate dance in a particular century and probably a palace in which the story unfolds . Many new members of an audience have been known to object to the applause greeting the last bow .  It breaks the continuity of the dance .	None

Other practices that once held up the flow of the dance were the continual closing in 5th position before a new step and the continual moving of the arms through 1st position at every change of weight or during a ports de bras  .	None
708	audience	2	This last convention is invaluable in early training because it helps to stabilise balance during the transfer from one foot to the other and is also valuable in such ballets as Birthday Offering  as it echoes the period and style of Glazounov 's  music .  But this would get very boring if used too often .  Another old rule decreed that dancers never turned their backs on the	audience	, because all had to face the king , the centre of attention . The turn of a dancer 's  back can now become part of a beautiful line being made in a total picture .  Today 's  dancers not only dance fur an audience .	None
709	audience	2	A sudden change of aulement  ,  an unusual turn in - out of legs or arms ,  or quick jumps up and then down to the floor followed by a roll over or even a somersault can accentuate the particular place that unusual movement has in the whole design .  Swift changes in the dimensions covered in any linear design are nowhere more obvious than in Ashton 's  five abstract ballets and his example is now being followed by David Bintley in his Choros  and Consort Lessons  .  In fact such unusual movements often arouse the	audience	and their Colleagues . Classical dance patterns In classical ballet the patterns and groupings delineated by the dancers '  bodies are usually symmetrical and evenly balanced over the whole stage .	None
710	audience	2	It should be noted that a similar order of precedence exists in Ashton 's  Scnes de Ballet  as in Petipa 's  The Sleeping Beauty  which was supposed to be an evocation of a court ballet at the time of Louis XIV .  However ,  when ballets were performed for the public ,  professional dancers took the place of courtiers and technical innovations had to be made .  The dancers now appeared on a stage before a wide	audience	or to the most important performers . They had to adapt their movements to cover a larger space which was like a box with one side only being open to public gaze .  They had to pay greater attention to the placing of each step and pose within the new framework .	None
711	audience	2	It is when this mass of dancers divides and moves to the sides that the open space available for dancing is exposed fur the first time .  Before this the slowmoving dancers in their wide spreading tutus and veiled arms have hidden it from view .  Its exposure prepares the	audience	for the brilliant solos to follow . When Marie Camargo shortened her skirts and removed the heels from her shoes ,  jumps and batterie  first entered the vocabulary .  These lent brilliance to the footwork which became more intricate and thus more interesting .	None

He insisted that his dancers told their own story by using the many conventional gestures familiar to theatregoers throughout Europe .

As a Greek and Latin scholar he had found them described in the works of ancient authors who wrote about the moods ,  emotions and actions of all the actors involved in their dramas .  By 1717 these gestures were accepted practice by actors to reinforce the meaning of the words spoken and particularly by members   of the commedia dell'arte travelling troupes who produced mime plays .

716	audience	2	They cannot be too strict about this relationship ,  for the score ,  whether commissioned or arranged ,  will only give some flavour of the traditional ways of singing and dancing .  This can be easily recognised if Bizet 's  music for Carmen  is compared with De Falla 's  fur The Three - Cornered Hat  .  Yet the former has sufficient Spanish flavour , as does the Minkus score fur Don Quixote , for	audiences	to believe that characters really would perform in the way they do to the kind of music provided . When Dauberval removed to Bordeaux ,  the audience ,  like those elsewhere in france ,  was largely unaware of the grandeur of aristocratic entertainment .  It welcomed the new ideas in La Fille Mal Garde  because the characters portrayed were familiar and were living in the farms and vineyards .	None

718	audience	2	In real life the onlookers are part of the activity and usually join in .  In ballets such as Petrushka  and Rodeo  they are wandering around ,  watching and occasionally responding to the dancers '  efforts .  But	audiences	sitting and watching can only join in the fun in their imagination and if the dancers are sufficiently out - going . Choreographers like Bournonville often borrowed from regional dancing ,  which he eagerly studied wherever he travelled .  It is useful for would - be choreographers to examine his ballets and discover that he mostly set them in countries possessing easily recognised characteristics .	None
719	audience	2	This was followed by a wedding staged as if the Bride and Groom were being manipulated as puppets by a group of servants ,  a particular japanese theatrical tradition .  The final scene was a formal celebration and prayer fur a wife giving birth .  The movements were strongly influenced by the stylised Bugako players and were appropriate to each scene , but oddly enough the whole appeared too static , as if a series of japanese prints was being paraded before the	audience	. At this time a MacMillan ballet was expected to be ,  above all ,  about dancing .  The apparent ritualistic  posing ,  although strongly performed and easy to understand ,  did not appeal in the same way as his Song of the Earth  .	None
720	audience	2	Here he creates the many happy and not so happy incidents that can occur on a skating rink where even a professional can miss a trick .  Jerome Robbins has a knack of using occupational gesture in many of his works and most particularly in The Concert  ,  where the well - observed behaviour of the many different concert - goers arouses much laughter .  Those in the	audience	who have had to suffer such behaviour in a concert hall , whilst trying to listen to a brilliant musician , know that his remarks about certain characters are only too true . Whatever occupational gesture  ( mime )  a choreographer chooses to use in ballet ,  it must be envisaged in terms of dance without the use of props .  Even such mundane tasks as eating or drinking have found a place in some ballets .	None
721	audience	2	No better example of such objectivity was Ashton 's  own playing of the Onlooker in Nocturne  .  He stood silent and still ,  watching the tragedy of the Poor Girl who was being rejected by the Rich Man .  His two tiny gestures said everything and expressed the	audience	's understanding of the plot . He made one as if he should try and comfort her ,  but turned away ,  walked upstage and on the balcony with his back to the audience ,  raised his arms widely only to drop them helplessly .  No one could fail to understand the Onlooker 's  reaction to the tale just unfolded .	None

723	audience	2	composers ,  authors ,  poets and painters ,  began to strengthen the national features of their work .  More typical and traditional folk dance steps and customs were absorbed into demi - caractre  dance and were accompanied by idiomatic features from national music .  When this happened , however , even the traditional features became more stereotyped because choreographers used only those which the	audience	could easily recognise and which were commonly seen and heard in a particular country . It was from such traditional dance that Fokine ,  at the instigation of Diaghilev ,  devised the first truly national ballets by breaking away from the sterotyped steps .  Instead ,  Fokine based his design  ( as did the composer Stravinsky and the artist Korovin  ( later Goncharova )  )  on the folk tales ,  customs ,  traditional dances and music of Russia without in any way conforming to the generally accepted rules of classical technique .	None
724	audience	2	The movements of Hungarian dance are down to the earth whereas those of Scottish Highland dance are away from the earth .   3 In order to display particular native features , the traditional circle , chain and couple dance formations must be broken up and opened outwards so that the steps are seen clearly by the	audience	. This is after all what the first balletmasters did when professionals appeared on stage and were no longer surrounded by the court where all eyes were focused on the king  ( see page 76 )  .  4	None
725	audience	2	His dance throughout has its base in the classical vocabulary but MacMillan has coloured it by gestures from cabaret and vaudeville dance traditions ,  which serve to reveal not only class  differences in behaviour but also genuine feelings .  This is why Bratfisch is so important .  Without him there is no other character with whom the	audience	can feel sympathy . Ashton 's  Alain shows yet another aspect of the sad clown or little man and can ,  when subtly played ,  gain much sympathy because ,  while things seem to go right ,  he is so pleased with life .  His delight first makes itself evident during his solo for Lise even though technical mistakes keep on happening .	None

His delight first makes itself evident during his solo for Lise even though technical mistakes keep on happening .  When he pulls himself up or corrects his placing or step he beams on the	audience	as , for example , when he finishes with his back after a pirouette and hastily turns to face them . The same happens during the pas de deux  that is supposed to be with Lise .  Each time they arrive at a pose ,  Colas somehow steals the expected kiss or holds Lise in the proper climax as Alain strikes what he believes to be the proper pose .	None
727	audience	2	Man 's  inhumanity to Man The Burrow ;  A Distant Drummer It is important to note that these ballets were created by MacMillan whose aim has been to convince	audiences	that dance in ballet belongs to the reality of life and to show how life can be manipulated . He first described this in Noctambules  which  showed how the characters portrayed were manipulated by the Hypnotist .  Manipulation was shown more dramatically in A Distant Drummer  .	None
728	audience	2	Yet Ashton found ways of so moulding classical dance that the ladies even danced sur les pointes  in so Edwardian a setting .  The ballet could have been entered under the title of demi -   caractre  ,  but those people were not figments of the imagination .  They really lived , were visualised by the composer , then the choreographer and recognised by old friends in the	audience	. Robbins Dances at a Gathering  could be called a romantic ballet because it uses classical technique coloured by natural emotional expression .  It communicates the moods ,  sentiments and behaviour of young people meeting to enjoy each other 's  company as young people always do though not usually to Chopin 's  romantic music .	None
729	audience	2	MacMillan 's  The Burrow  ,  based on the real diary of Anne Frank ,  was possibly the most explicit and moving of all his efforts to depict reality in terms of dance  ( see page 30 )  .  The classification of today 's  ballets becomes more difficult as their stories ,  themes and music get more complicated .  Very occasionally , the opposite happens , e.g. in Robbins ' Glass Pieces to John Cage 's minimal music , the constant repetition of musical phrases paralleled by dance phrases lost the interest of an	audience	bored with too much meaningless to - ing and fro - ing . Modern style After studying the above ballets it may well be asked what is modern style 	None
730	audience	2	As explained elsewhere  classical technique is the most demanding .  It has evolved from the simplest folk through the mannered court and finally to the expert classical dance .  It is designed to display both dancer and dance to the best advantage from the	audience	's point of view . It is a strict discipline upon which to build .  Its exponents are trained to feel how to move with each part of their bodies and to know how their movements must be coordinated to produce one or another step or pose .	None
731	audience	2	The enchanements  can be danced to any time signature ,  phrasing or tempo .

These are the full stops to a paragraph that give the audience an opportunity to sum up  as it were  how the Bride 's  hair is cut ;  why the men convey the Groom to the Bride 's  house ;  how the Bride and Groom are blessed by their parents ;  and so on .  By so phrasing each paragraph and bringing each incident to a proper conclusion , Nijinska gives both dancers and	audience	time to consider what has been done and what is yet to happen . The nature of the formal shapes made by the dancers '  bodies and limbs as they move into and hold a picture must be evaluated .  Nijinska insisted on the use of the pointes  in order to emphasise the elongated portraits of the Byzantine Saints ,  thus the dancers '  bodies mostly face the audience but their arms and legs turn inwards and are seen mostly in profile .

None
734	audience	2	It is impossible exactly to define what is modern dance because the body is the same that has danced for hundreds of years .  Choreographers cannot in any way change the ways in which their dancers move .  The	audience	recognise physical movement for itself alone whereas those who theorise and attempt to define what they mean by such terms as post or neo - modern , contemporary , avant - garde , etc. base their works on intellectual concepts which need to be discussed in words . Thus the audience fail to understand everything that is offered .  Dance is firstly a physical activity and if it is obscured by complicated costumes ,  props ,  machinery ,  lighting and stage effects ,  it ceases to be relevant to anything but the cleverness of the producer .

This Champagne image helped it recover .  then , in the 1970s , the pendulum of style swung back to the cloudy , sedimented type , which is seen as a more natural product by today 's young	audience	. If the cloudy type is made in the traditional way ,  as Erdinger is ,  the sediment is yeast left during a secondary fermentation in the bottle .  Some examples from non - specialist brewers are simply sedimented with the residual protein that would normally be removed after brewing .	None
738	audience	2	Stepan 's  aesthetic convictions are Dostoevsky 's  ,  and Stepan 's  speech is an hysterical ,  summarizing take - off of Dostoevsky 's  journalism ,  itself no model of temperateness .  The narrative maximizes  Stepan 's  vulnerability ,  perching him on a platform amid the malcontents and troublemakers and the much larger number of those humble ,  obscure people who are enduring more or less passively the chaos of the fte .  He is holding forth about beauty to an	audience	which has been short - changed over food and drink and entertainment . Therefore he is asking for trouble ,  and he receives it suddenly and in full measure ,  above the groundswell of heckling ,  at the hands of a divinity student who reminds him at the top of his voice about Fedka ,  a dangerous escaped convict now roaming our town and originally a serf of Stepan 's  whom he sold into military service to pay a gambling debt :  If you had not lost him at cards ,  would he have got into prison 	None
739	audience	3	Nuttall has elsewhere given a mischievous account of an academic occasion in which a speaker insisted on asserting ,  It is a truth that the workers are oppressed .  This ,  Nuttall remarks ,  acted as a red rag .  It was as if the logical conservatism ' of his remark was more significant and more offensive to his ( predominantly left - wing )	audience	than its thoroughly socialist content . In A New Mimesis  Nuttall accused Hawkes of collective cultural solipsism .  Hawkes ,  in turn ,  gave the book a mockingly dismissive review in the TLS  ,  without mentioning Nuttall 's  accusation against him.	None
740	audience	2	She writes :  And if the reading public as a whole is shrinking ,  if literature is increasingly relegated to the schools as something to be studied  if ,  in a word ,  the majority of readers now are scholars  ( whether students or professional academics )   then the claims of literary theory to be our representative literary genre become stronger still .  What better inspiration could a literature of theory have than an	audience	composed of theorists and critics  This is not ,  I think ,  meant to be ironical ,  and it represents a quite logical development from the premiss that the whole production ,  definition ,  and reception of literature has now become intramural to the academy .  In this context ,  what goes on outside ,  what is actually written by poets and novelists ,  is of minor interest .	None
741	audience	2	When he brushed his cheek against hers or supported her waist in multiple pirouettes the sensual heat was unmissable .  Even Durante ,  who has a tendency to forget her character when she is dancing ,  responded at times with an uncharacteristically voluptuous abandon .  For those of us less fortunate in the	audience	Bocca 's technical prowess was devastating enough . In the austere Shades act he perhaps overdid the stunts  - but otherwise the height of his jumps coupled with the careless speed of his preparation was breathtaking .  So too was his exceptional ability to accelerate or delay his pirouettes at will  a dancer for whom gravity is only a trivial inconvenience .	None
742	audience	2	The pivotal notion of Spandau prison being pulled down and replaced by a supermarket was one which greatly excited Brenton ,  signifying at a stroke both Western Europe 's  descent into cynical consumerism and the wiping out of history .  The production would be high - tech ,  with key scenes performed simultaneously on stage and on videotape .  Watching the characters being bugged on TV monitors , the	audience	would themselves be made to feel under surveillance . Not a madly promising menu ,  and fraught with predictable dangers .  Compared with the mysteries surrounding the deaths of President Kennedy or Marilyn Monroe ,  the controversy surrounding Spandau 's  93 - year - old inmate is about as interesting as the fall of a dead leaf .

Compared with the mysteries surrounding the deaths of President Kennedy or Marilyn Monroe ,  the controversy surrounding Spandau 's  93 - year - old inmate is about as interesting as the fall of a dead leaf .  And dispersing the	audience	's attention among nine separate TV sets is a sure way of dispersing any atmosphere you may have been lucky enough to set up. In the event  90 minutes without an interval  it quickly became clear that all the surveillance in the house would be cruelly trained on those unfortunates doomed to flesh out Brenton 's  thoughts .  The plot ,  insofar as one could discern it ,  was both labyrinthine and self - cancellingly ambiguous ,  built round an interview in a psychiatric hospital between a journalist and the grief - obsessed widow of a German professor who had bequeathed a videotape casting doubt on the official version of Hess 's  death .

The other characters were a sold - out leftie academic ( who drew much knowing laughter from the first - night	audience	) , a right - wing academic , a military automaton , and an Amstrad word - processor which enigmatically took the floor in a central scene . The script cut from psychiatry to politics to history to Euro - moralising with dizzy speed ;  film - clip collages of Hitler saluting ,  Hess  ( or not - Hess )  in the mortuary ,  hamburger ads ,  crumbling buildings ,  a screaming man in seventeenth - century dress ,  and the widow miming Hess 's  improbable suicide all chimed in an unholy jangle with the events on stage .  The questions raised may have been interesting ,  but the answers given were tritely familiar ;  the authorial tone was relentlessly baleful .	None
745	audience	3	Economic Outlook :  A deficit between consenting adults By SARAH HOGG The Chancellor is trying to convince his political	audience	that Britain 's deficit ( now running at close on 4 per cent of national income ) is not a problem ; and to convince the markets not to sell sterling . In both arguments ,  the next two weeks  which include a probable German interest - rate rise and an unavoidable Conservative Party conference  will be critical .  If Mr Lawson can hold off a base rate rise at least until he can blame the Germans ,  that will make his political task a fraction easier ;  but not much .	None
746	audience	4	In these cases the interests of justice may demand special requirements such as ,  for example ,  that the preparation and presentation of the case be in separate and independent hands .  In the second category ,  general civil cases ,  parties should be able to choose their own lawyers because the interests of justice would be inherently less likely to fetter the client 's  right of choice .  Lord Donaldson implied , however , that solicitors who exercised their new rights of	audience	in these cases ought to be expected to concentrate on advocacy . While emphasising that he had not reached any firm conclusions ,  Lord Donaldson 's  voice will be a powerful one in behind - the - scenes manoeuvres as rules governing the exercise of the new advocacy rights are hammered out away from the parliamentary battlefield .  The rules will be drawn up by the Law Society having regard to suggestions made by a new lay - dominated independent advisory committee on legal education and conduct .	None
747	audience	4	But on the other hand ,  the statute will also include a clear intention that extended rights of audience are put into practical effect as soon as the necessary conditions have been met .  A majority of judges said in their response to the Green Papers that standards of conduct and competence might decline if lawyers who worked in partnerships and took instructions directly from clients  ( most solicitors )  were allowed widespread access to the higher courts .  Lord Donaldson 's formula for settling the rights of	audience	controversy was viewed as an adept political move by some delegates . Alternative dividing lines which have been informally mooted ,  such as simply restricting solicitor - advocates in Crown Court jury trials to the less serious cases ,  had been viewed as difficult to support as a matter of principle .  Lord Donaldson 's  remarks were greeted with cautious enthusiasm by Bar leaders .	None
748	audience	3	Suddenly she caught sight of the child 's  mother .  Immediately ,  her expression and pace of approach changed and instead of the lambasting ,  or worse ,  she had seemed about to deliver ,  she gave the child a tolerant smile and began to pick up the scattered cans .  Most of us have experienced similar examples of such	audience	effects on behaviour : playing a game to perfection ( or otherwise ) when the team selector is present , for instance . What you do depends very much on who might be watching ,  often with good reason .  Prudently taking cognisance of onlookers also turns out to be important in the social behaviour of other primates .

Edward Kawak ,  who won in four successive years  ( 1982 - 1985 )  ,  mysteriously representing France ,  Lebanon and West Germany ,  was too close for comfort in second place  ( he was French this time )  .  Out in the	audience	it was bedlam , each Rodin pose greeted with wolf whistles , cat calls and enough indecent suggestions and doubles entendres to script a new Carry On series .

Cricket and golf , Bromley says , are both minorities , judging by the size of their television	audience	. Cricket had the fourth largest aggregate audience on television in 1988 ,  according to the figures of AGB Sports Watch/ BARB ,  but over so many hours that its audience at any one time is insignificant .  The final climactic day of golf 's  Ryder Cup last week still attracted fewer than five million viewers to BBC 's  Sunday Grandstand .	None
755	audience	3	A PAIR of tramps in the cellar of an abandoned hotel lengthily airing their psychological underwear until evicted by a  ( superficially )  heartless boilerman :  we seem to have been here before .  But there is not much Pinter ,  and definitely no Beckett ,  about this solid piece of middle - class music theatre by the Canadian composer Quenten Doolittle ,  which began its short British tour by the Banff Music Theatre at the Chapter Arts Centre ,  Cardiff .  Doolittle has based himself on what seems a pellucidly consequential and intelligently written play by Rex Deverell ( also the librettist ) ; and though the piece is offered as best suited to alternative	audiences	, it cuts an oddly respectable figure in the modestly louche surroundings of Chapter . Two reasons strike me for this .  First ,  the work is dramaturgically polite ;  it consults its audience too much to be taken seriously as drop - out theatre .	None
756	audience	2	His Cabinet experience ,  he unfolded ,  was but a small part of the assembled case .  The pleasure comes later ,  when you elevate yourself to the status of a student and a teacher  that 's  how I see the job .  At the other end , Bryan Gould ( A Future for Socialism ) held his	audience	spellbound as he charted Labour 's recovery from assumptions of unchallenged rightness , once taken for granted and shattered by Thatcherism . Austin Mitchell  ( Beyond the Blue Horizon )  ,  and Giles Radice  ( Labour 's  Path to Power  the New Revisionism )  were there too .  And although their analyses overlapped only in the margins ,  there was a burst of literary bitchiness when Mr Radice 's  enthusiasm for the opportunties of the Common Market was excoriated by the other three .

757	audience	2	At Stourbridge Town Hall in the West Midlands last night ,  where Botham began his tour ,  those who came instead of a night out at the pictures were somewhat surprised to find themselves treated to a night out at the pictures .  The entire first half consisted of film of Botham 's  greatest moments ,  liberally interspersed with more film of him drinking the sponsor 's  lager .  But in the final hour he did deliver the goods , taking impromptu questions from the	audience	. Not that it was going to be easy to improve on the earlier filmed interview when ,  asked why he rarely practised in the nets ,  he replied :  I do n't like confined spaces .  One was tempted to applaud such spontaneous wit ,  but serious faces all around showed that this was not meant in jest .	None
758	audience	3	The Theatre Royal ,  Plymouth ,  is about to send a highly commercial product into the West End .  For Elijah Moshinsky ,  there are great advantages to starting a show out of town .  It seems to me that a new play like Shadowlands needs to be exposed to different	audiences	before it settles down. It 's  especially important in a play like this ,  which is such a delicate and sensitive piece of writing ,  that the actors grow together as a cohesive group .  I think that it is much easier to create that atmosphere in a good out - of - town theatre like Plymouth rather than to prepare a star vehicle in a draughty rehearsal room somewhere in London .	None
759	audience	3	Westerns are no longer a cheap option .  The classic western TV series were filmed in back - lots ,  or in the semi - desert 20 miles from Los Angeles .  Modern	audiences	no longer accept plastic bushes , and the southern Californian suburban sprawl means the production companies have to take their horses and cows to locations far away in Arizona or Montana . David Jacobs also points out that the cost of hiring a stage - coach is now prohibitive .  At one time there were dozens of companies which specialised in renting out western paraphernalia .	None

762	audience	2	Definite confirmation of ITV 's  withdrawal from the fixture can be expected today .  This First Division match ,  always one of the most emotional ,  fiercely fought contests of the season ,  was originally scheduled for last Saturday .  As this date did not come within ITV 's planned winter programme of Sunday afternoon games a new date was proposed , December 22 , a Friday night with a kick - off at 8.05 , prime - time viewing guaranteed to capture a huge	audience	in holiday mood . Neither club was pleased ,  supporters were furious and Liverpool were reported to have protested strongly .  There was much concern expressed on Merseyside about the safety aspects of a match kicking off that late in the evening on the day when all the tradtional pre - Christmas parties are held in offices and factories .

763	audience	2	But the trouble ,  you feel ,  lies with Belushi .  It may be that his gifts lay in the thrill and risk of live performance ,  losing their savour in aspic ;  or ,  more likely ,  that his genius was always over - rated .  Wired purports to be about America not just Belushi , but this is trite stuff about decadence in Tinseltown ; what it has to say about the nation is nugatory , unless you count a depressing scene in which an	audience	collapses in laughter while the Voice of its Generation ( as Bluto in Animal House ) stuffs a sandwich down his pants . Belushi 's  a book ,  believes Woodward ,  but one is inclined to agree with the cop who pronounces him just another fat junkie who went belly - up. K - 9  ( 12 )  ,  which stars James Belushi ,  hints at the less than glittering screen career that might have awaited his elder brother ,  had he lived .	None
764	audience	3	What we were offered ,  if definition is needed ,  might be called ballet - pantomime :  it was certainly not opera .  As in the best ballet - pantomimes ,  the message is direct in origin and presentation .  At times the method is decidedly crude , especially in a hint of West Side Story which concludes the overture , doubtless aimed at today 's	audience	. Oddly enough ,  Ghanashyam  ( A Broken Branch )  approaches opera in the nature of the story it tells :  originating in village festivities ,  the tale unfolds a rake 's  progress towards perdition ,  in this case via drugs ,  but with an extra metaphysical twist when the spirit of the departed returns to inhabit his wife .  While the intentions of the plot are clear enough ,  it is not significantly developed by the dance .	None
765	audience	2	Providing a continuous texture ,  the music never pales and only in the shock - horror theme associated with drugs approaches banality .  Apart from some relentless over - amplification ,  the music ,  directed by Ashit Desai ,  emerges with enormous verve .  As a whole , this grand spectacle was a rare hit with what seemed to be as varied an	audience	as any opera company is likely to find these days.

766	audience	2	Endesha Ida Mae Holland ,  the author of this veiled autobiography ,  is described in the programme as a popular lecturer and story - teller :  she works the same seam as Maya Angelou ,  Toni Morrison and Alice Walker  ( whose spirit she fulsomely invokes ,  and whose book The Color Purple she implicitly recalls at every turn )  .  But Holland 's  particular trademark is a cute and cloying sentimentality ,  with pathos laid on thick .  Her story - telling has no obliqueness , no mystery ; everything is slowly and patiently explained , as though the	audience	was a fidgety bunch of six - year - olds . The two directors have done their best ,  speeding the tale along on the wings of Bessie Smith and mouth - organ blues .  And the actresses themselves are a delight :  Josette Bushell - Mingo has an extraordinarily mobile face and an infectiously comic manner ,  Joy Richardson shows an uncanny ability to get inside a 10 - year - old 's  skin ,  and Angela Bruce ,  as the mother ,  has natural authority .

768	audience	3	Piecemeal highlights are all very well ,  but viewers tend to be creatures of habit and ,  at present ,  a short burst of goals every Saturday night is just a tease ;  an uninitiated visitor would never guess that football was the national game .  Within ITV 's  ranks ,  there is concern that last season 's  gains have been wasted .  The overlord Greg Dyke , having paid a minimum of 11m a year for exclusive rights to the League ( at the current rate of inflation , the four - year , index - linked bill could soar over 50m ) , hit his	audience	target of eight million when Manchester United beat Liverpool thrillingly on New Year 's Day .

769	audience	2	Before a demoralising defeat when challenging Mike Tyson for the world heavyweight championship two years ago Biggs would have probably been too dangerous a proposition for Mason but something has gone from him since then and he was unable to fulfil bold pre - fight assertions .  Both men took heavy blows and by withstanding the best of the American 's  punches Mason at least emphasised that he has a strong enough chin .  It was not a contest to excite the	audience	and there must have been some anxiety in Mason 's corner as it approached a critical stage . Mason was ahead but Biggs for a while looked the stronger man and employed his superior technique to suggest that Mason might be running into trouble .  He took four of six rounds and yet without ever making his supporters believe that a decisive victory was on the cards .	None
770	audience	2	Out Of The Blue was fractured in the extreme ,  Heartland became a loose - limbed skank ,  and Marr more than proved his worth on Violence of Truth .  Good as the concert was ,  it was rather too middle of the road for a tour titled The The vs The World and ,  sadly for fans of the more paranoid earlier work ,  Johnson 's  attempts to darken the proceedings ended up looking silly .  By not uttering a word to the	audience	, then keeping the stage shrouded in smoke , lit only from the back in lurid purple , orange and red , and reducing the band to shadowy figures looming out of a fog , he put so much distance between them and anybody past the regulation front - of - stage pogoers that attention easily wandered . And the over - use of an extra microphone ,  giving his voice the qualities of a US TV cop with a bull horn ,  made many of the lyrics unintelligible ,  removing the thrust of his carefully - penned portraits of despair .  Under the weight of such cliches ,  The The were about as dangerous as the average heavy metal band .	None
771	audience	2	IT SEEMS that even in its own time the thirteenth - century motet was considered by many to be a sophisticated ,  subtle genre ,  only likely to appeal to the literati .  That these generally complex ,  polytextual pieces can today appeal to an almost capacity house at the Wigmore Hall is largely due to two factors :  the superb singing of Gothic Voices ,  and the ability of their director ,  Christopher Page ,  to unlock the musical secrets of the past .  Over the years , Page has established himself as a medieval raconteur , delighting his audience with tales of , say , thirteenth - century Paris ; but anecdotes aside , he has also been refining the presentation and programming so that , almost without realising it , his	audiences	learn a good deal about the often totally unfamiliar music being performed . This concert ,  part of the Early Music Centre Festival ,  was one of the most overtly educative so far ,  with even ,  at one point ,  an illustrated guide to composing a motet in five easy stages .  Yet there is nothing condescendingly didactic in Page 's  manner ,  nor anything textbookish about Gothic Voices '  performance .	None

This is a generation for whom the war years remain vivid and the Empire had real meaning .  Casual references by our political leaders to what seems to them to be the quite recent past can be lost on a young	audience	. The new students are also new voters .

Every dozen or so cheeses I 'd sigh and say Gra ,  is this really funny   and he 'd puff on his pipe calmly and say ,  Yes ,  get on with it .  I wished he 'd had the same confidence in front of	audiences	because he was probably the most talented actor of us all . But he found the Python TV recordings a terrible strain ,  and some of his drinking was an attempt to dampen that fear .  After he gave up the booze at Christmas 1977  for good  -  he gave us his splendid Brian which is as clever and well - judged a piece of comic acting as you 'll see .	None
774	audience	2	The range of sports programmes ,  live and packaged ,  is extraordinary ,  while the videotape market is booming .  No boxing match seems too trivial for live coverage ,  basketball and volleyball draw vast audiences ,  Formula One racing grips the nation and there is an inexhaustible appetite for football ,  to the extent that Saturday night English soccer is a major viewing habit .  Thus battle has been joined between RAI and the private channels for an	audience	which Italian advertisers regard as pre - eminently desirable .

It guarantees record viewing figures in Italy ,  more than films or variety shows .	None
775	audience	2	Finvest 's  men have been making the bidding against RAI harder and harder by the season and now they are fighting on a match - by - match basis .  RAI protests that this amounts to a colossal waste of money since it previously acquired Eurovision rights for nothing more than the duty of reciprocal access to material from Italy .  But the pickings could be huge : the	audience	for RAI 's recorded Italian Sunday football in the United States and Canada may be as high as 50 million , while down in Latin America they hunger for footage of Maradona at almost any price . Berlusconi ,  unabashed by his own creation of what amounts to a duopoly ,  bangs the drum of the free market against RAI ,  claiming that the licence payers '  money is being squandered to break down unwanted competition .  The Director - General ,  Biagio Agnes  ( like all RAI executives a political party appointee )  ,  has angrily accused the Berlusconi camp of dragging in even the authorities of the state and seizing every opportunity to attack the public broadcasting service with statements of such arrogance that they betray weakness and sheer lack of class despite  ( Berlusconi 's  )  economic power and much - vaunted influential friendships .

Robert Saxton ,  in these pages ,  recently denied that there was any longer a problem with contemporary music ,  and instead lectured the audience about paying closer attention .  He did not mention that one definition of a composer 's talent is that he can write music that compels an	audience	's attention . If the Orphic myth defines the power of music ,  it is because Orpheus compelled an entirely hostile audience to listen to him. Mr Saxton also dismissed the idea of music as entertainment .	None

ENO ,  I am glad to say ,  is proud to be dismissed by him to the purgatory reserved for this despicable activity ,  and more than 450,000 people pass through our doors each year to prove it .  If a composer remembers to keep this	audience	entertained , think what he can say to them all at the same time . An entertained audience is actually there and listening :  a bored one has usually gone to dinner .  Rehearsing Kurt Weill 's  Street Scene ,  I am in daily contact with a composer who was not embarrassed to entertain ,  nor to adapt his vision to the audience .	None
783	audience	2	They cannot expect to affect the development of a genius like Janacek .  But that realisation should not be a disappointment :  rather it liberates us from the job of creating masterpieces ,  and gives us a much more achievable task .  That is quite simply to reduce by say 25 per cent the amount of time the eager opera	audience	wishes to spend listening to famous old works about famous old people and places , and instead increase the amount of time it wishes to spend listening to new works about ordinary people now . This is an exercise in persuasion ,  and requires composers who will focus their art on the simple and fundamental act of communication with their enthusiastic but tired ,  inattentive ,  restless ,  distracted and easily bored fellow human beings who none the less long to hear themselves in a not necessarily flattering mirror of music .  Our society needs to be given the chance to hear its own heartbeat in its own music  for pleasure first ,  then also for knowledge and understanding .	None
784	audience	2	MUSIC / Unholy row :  CBSO / Rattle  Birmingham By JAN SMACZNY THE MOST appealing moment in Mark - Anthony Turnage 's engagingly chatty introduction to Three Screaming Popes , his Feeney commission premiere for the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra at the Birmingham Town Hall , came with a stated desire that his music should be accessible to an	audience	. Well ,  the Popes ,  in terrifying orchestral sonorities ,  certainly screamed and the new composition was ,  indeed ,  accessible to the audience .  This substantial ,  15 - minute orchestral movement was inspired by three paintings of Innocent X by Francis Bacon ,  themselves based on Velasquez .	None
785	audience	2	According to these sources ,  the Pope and the Secretariat of State intend to push for a firm public commitment to legalisation by Mr Gorbachev when he visits Italy and the Vatican at the end of November .  They say the decision to step up overt pressure came quickly after the Vatican learned from Italian Foreign Ministry officials that Mr Gorbachev 's  visit was being curtailed to less than three full days. On Thursday , the Pope spoke forcibly to an	audience	of Ukrainian Catholic bishops , recalling that the native branch of their church had been driven into the catacombs , suffering the martyrdom of her bishops and priests , deportations , arrests and the closures of churches and monasteries . The cries of these Catholics reach Rome with ever - increasing urgency ,  he said .  The campaign of hostility and accusations against this church and her priests does not help reforms ,  but hinders them .	None
786	audience	2	The confidence displayed by reformers such as Mr Nyers and Imre Pozsgay ,  who introduced the new party 's  programme ,  was in sharp contrast to the air of resignation in the conservative rows .  Karoly Grosz ,  the outgoing general secretary ,  cut a lonely figure as he bowed out ,  dropping hints that in future he would be taking a back seat in politics .  Mr Grosz was the only senior politician yesterday with the courage to stand up for Communism in front of a hostile	audience	. As a parting shot ,  he even attacked reformists for resorting to Stalinist tactics and admitted to having differences of philosophy and outlook with Comrade Poszgay .  But Mr Poszgay 's  radical programme looked safe last night .	None

This last attraction may have special appeal to the article 's	audience	, since it was published in the Millwall programme , raising the spectre of the League 's most feared supporters tooled - up on the terraces , humming the William Tell theme instead of No one likes us .

788	audience	2	A private West German television company ,  SAT 1 ,  will pay more than 5.2m per year to broadcast the tournament and other ATP events in Germany ,  and the mayor of Frankfurt ,  Dr Volker Hauff ,  has promised to showcase the event with a week of concerts ,  exhibitions and international symposiums .  Tiriac is still miffed that the ATP final did not come to Stuttgart :  The ATP told me to join the auction ,  but I am too good to have to do that .  He expresses scepticism about Frankfurt 's boast of being able to fill their stadium for every session : I do n't think they will get 9,000 every day , but I would have achieved that here , where we have developed an	audience	for the game . Frankfurt is not a traditional tennis city .  It is not like Hamburg ,  where they have had a tournament for a hundred years and people would go out and watch tennis at 7 am ,  even in the freezing cold .	None
789	audience	2	It seems unlikely that the East German leaders feel much threatened by his tone .  If anything ,  they may be relieved to have got off so lightly ,  given that East Germany 's  aversion to a local brand of perestroika and glasnost has long been clear .  We do not doubt that the ( East German Communist Party ) is able through co - operation with all forces in society to find answers to all those questions which arise through the development of the republic and which interest its citizens , he told the huge	audience	gathered in the Palace of the Republic . Mr Gorbachev then warned against voices being raised in West Germany demanding the re - establishment of Germany under its 1937 borders .  He said he did not idealise the European order ,  but until now ,  it is precisely the recognition of post - war realities that ensures peace in Europe .	None
790	audience	2	In his Macbeth ,  the Scottish warlord became a Samurai warrior in 16th century Japan ,  bludgeoning his way to power beneath a cherry tree that rained white blossom down on him. Medea ,  first performed at the Edinburgh Festival in the outdoor courtyard of the Old College ,  ended with Medea in a chariot on the college roof ,  battered by the howling wind and rain .  The	audience	, transported with her , sat open - mouthed , oblivious to the rain pouring down their necks . This time ,  though ,  Ninagawa has brought over a Japanese classic .  Suicide For Love is adapted by Matsuyo Akimoto from three plays by the 17th century writer Chikamatsu Monzaemon and Ninagawa 's  production involves 73 actors ,  a swirling snow storm and a river on stage  the company ,  with true Japanese courtesy ,  provide plastic macs for the first two rows of spectators .	None
791	audience	3	Yet ,  Nakane adds ,  actors queue up to work with him and audiences flood to his shows .  Ninagawa points out that his style ,  combining East and West ,  ritual and freedom ,  in many ways mirrors life in Japan :  I get up and listen to Bach on my compact disc and have Japanese rice for breakfast .  But , more importantly , his productions ' stark expression of human vanity perhaps touches a pressurized Japanese	audience	. I feel there are too many people who cast no doubt on today 's  prosperous Japan .  Japan is twisted and warped .	None
792	audience	2	So his Contras behave like homicidal lager - louts ,  and his Sandinistas like palely scrupulous members of the SDP .  The production is cowboys and Indians first and last ,  with a buddy - movie section in between .  The	audience	file in to discover three actors sitting ragged and disconsolate under the eye of a fourth who is reading the Bible and shouting Shut up ! at intervals . After 10 minutes of this the action begins :  a jungle - skirmish in the wings ,  then an interrogation ,  with the Contras jeering and their victims rigid with fear .  There follows an atrocity off - stage ,  an American military adviser  ( Edward Peel )  watching with horribly convincing sexual excitement .	None
793	audience	2	It was a mark of her artistic intelligence and independence that she did not choose to dish up a pot - pourri of well tried favourites for the occasion ,  drawing attention to herself rather than the music .  True ,  in a first half devoted to the song repertory she allowed herself a Wolf group which included Mein Liebster ist so Klein and Ich hab ' in Penna. But she effortlessly avoided that exasperating coyness with which some seek to engage their	audience	, and the group also included the angelic Wir haben beide lange Zeit with whose chiming repetitions she wove an enchanting spell . To frame this more familiar fare ,  she presented songs by Enesco and Marx ,  bringing to them the skill of a dramatic singer without ever overstepping the bounds of intimate communion required by the genre .  Enesco is a major force in twentieth century music whose almost total neglect at present is quite astonishing ,  and if his little Poemes de Clement Marot show a limited aspect of his art ,  they still breathed an engaging wit and charm in Miss Cotrubas 's  heart - warming performance .	None
794	audience	2	Actually ,  she opened with Mozart 's  scena Misera ,  dove son which tested her somewhat at the top of the stave ,  but there followed arias from Manon ,  Don Pasquale and La Forza del Destino which she gave with commanding conviction ,  variety and characterisation .  Towards the close there was the feeling that she was forcing a little at the top ,  and that the middle voice was tiring .  But as she responded to the	audience	's affectionate plaudits with both Mimi 's and Violetta 's farewells it was the natural sweetness and dramatic presence of this fine artist that carried the day .

795	audience	3	All the signs are that radio is an exciting prospect  the forthcoming deregulation of the industry with associated changes in costs ,  and an expected boom in advertising revenues ,  is finally making the City take notice .  The potential for an advertising bonanza has come under the spotlight with the advent of splitting frequencies such as that undertaken by London 's  LBC last week .  Splitting frequencies transmitting different programmes on FM and AM could effectively double listening hours and provides two highly targeted	audiences	for advertising in a catchment area . In LBC 's  case ,  for example ,  the LBC Crown FM is going for the upmarket listener ,  while the medium wave service ,  London Talkback Radio ,  is pitching for the tabloid market and the dedicated followers of phone - ins .  Capital Radio ,  the other UK giant of the independents ,  has already split its frequencies ,  and before long all nine quoted independent stations are expected do so ,  albeit not always around the clock .	None
796	audience	3	Being Labour 's  money man is never easy ,  even when the party is still in opposition and you are as persuasive as Mr Smith .  But for once ,  the regular Labour conference task of reminding the party the public purse is not bottomless was put in the shade by the two looming Tory conference tasks of presenting the poll tax  and 15 per cent base rates .  The first of these is basically more difficult ; but Mr Patten has the advantage of novelty , the sheen of possible succession to Mrs Thatcher , a way with green words and blue	audiences	. He is wresting more money out of the Treasury to dilute the poll tax .  But it is far from clear yet how much .	None
797	audience	2	But it is far from clear yet how much .  As for the hoped - for recasting of the community charge ,  nothing short of transferring education to central government  which is simply not going to happen before the next election  can reduce it to a politically painless level .  Well , Mr Patten will do his best to make a silk purse out of a sow 's ear , and the	audience	will know it was not his idea . Nor ,  of course ,  was it Mr Lawson 's  .  After a year in which the Treasury 's  forecasting failures  ( notably that very large trade deficit )  have been rather obvious ,  it is only fair to recall that it did presciently point out just about every awkward little detail of the poll tax ,  from its automatic upward impact on inflation to the folly of providing local authorities with a golden opportunity to raise more tax while blaming the Government .

798	audience	2	Christ ,  he said ,  had openly defied the unholy alliance of the keepers of tradition and the power apparat .  His teaching was a challenge to Christians ,  more radical than it seemed :  The state is there for man ,  not the other way round ,  the socialist order is there for man ,  not the other way round .  For the first and only time , the	audience	applauded . Pastor Albani urged his congregation to follow Christ 's  way of non - violence :  We must try not to be another lot of historical victors hold to God 's  word and love your neighbour as yourself .  The congregation  perhaps 400 people ,  from outrageous punks to young women with babies  prayed with him to free us from the temptation of power ,  the temptation of violence  remove us from the barriers of ideology .

799	audience	2	RADIO / No laughing matter By ROBERT HANKS COMEDIANS are supposed to work better with an	audience	. Not always though :  witness the strange ,  sad case of Arnold Brown and Company  ( Radio 4 ,  Saturday )  ,  a series which slips neatly into the BBC tradition of vaguely funny cabaret .  Much of Arnold Brown 's  strength as a stand - up comedian lies in his eyebrows ,  a pair of fat black ,  hyperactive caterpillars .	None
800	audience	2	I gave him a real dressing - down. This is not a particularly good joke ,  but it was delivered neatly .  Not a snigger to suggest that anybody in the	audience	even knew this was a joke . The cheek ,  Brown added .  ( Silence .  )	None
801	audience	2	The effect of this is ,  curiously for a man who claims to have been ejected from the Library Theatre in Manchester for being overdue with his punchlines ,  to slow things down. Brown is n't a man with a big punch ;  it 's  those telling body - blows that sap your opponent ,  plus some sly head - butts in the clinch .  Put him in the ring with an	audience	that you ca n't see , and he seems to be delivering butterfly - taps . The Law Game  ( Radio 2 ,  Tuesday )  also has an audience response problem ,  perhaps because the format is tired ;  after all ,  it is in its fourteenth series .  The way it works is this :  Shaw Taylor introduces three short scenes in which actors have rows ,  go to industrial tribunals ,  issue death threats and so forth .	None
802	audience	2	The way it works is this :  Shaw Taylor introduces three short scenes in which actors have rows ,  go to industrial tribunals ,  issue death threats and so forth .  If necessary ,  Shaw then adds details  ( who sued whom )  ,  and a panel of celebrities is asked who won and why ,  or who got sent down and for how long .  The Law Game suffers uniquely by its	audience	: you know that they are there , because they applaud at the beginning . But after that ,  every joke belly - flops into silence .  Well ,  almost every joke :  when celebrity panellist Duggie Brown said backside ,  how they roared !	None
803	audience	2	After 10 minutes of this week 's  edition I was too embarrassed to go on listening .  It is really very dull .  That comedians work better with an	audience	is also one of the more convincing justifications for democracy . Peter Hennessy is conducting a brief series of interviews with ex - prime ministers ,  on the theme of Premiership  ( Radio 3 ,  Wednesday )  .  This week ,  he put a good case for regarding Alec Douglas - Home ,  Lord Home of the Hirsel ,  as one of the most under - rated comedians of the last 30 years .	None
804	audience	2	There are times when this universe seems excessively ,  even arbitrarily ,  bleak .  Like Peter Brook 's  Endgame - inspired King Lear in the Sixties ,  this Macbeth takes the risk of narrowing the play 's  potential dramatic range in order to create a particular emphasis .  Limited scope exists for actors to develop individual characters : there is little room , in particular , to explore tensions between the sympathy and horror that Macbeth 's conflicts can elicit in an	audience	. Any loss in emotional or dramatic range ,  however ,  is generally compensated for by the fearsome intensity of the vision that results ,  and the compelling stylishness with which it is communicated .  Moving ,  like the witches ,  with confident ,  implacable force ,  the Citizens '  creates a Macbeth machine to assault a Scottish audience 's  expectations of this most familiar of Shakespeare 's  plays ,  leaving it ,  by the end ,  thoroughly drained and disturbed .

805	audience	4	Twenty intending solicitors or barristers are being sought immediately for articles or pupillage ,  at starting salaries of 12,672 .  Sponsorship through professional exams will also be available .  The Crown Prosecution Service will continue the fight to get at least limited rights of	audience	in the Crown Court for its lawyers once the new advisory committee for legal education and conduct is set up under the Government 's White Paper plans for the legal profession , Fiona King , a recruitment specialist at the service said yesterday . The service is short of 369 lawyers ,  but it has received 517 inquiries about its own articled clerk and pupillage scheme launched in May .  Twenty - three trainee lawyers are already in post ,  with 175 about to be interviewed .	None
806	audience	2	Go to the Third Eye Centre tomorrow ,  and you 'll find bed mattresses bolted to the wall ,  tarred and feathered ,  and covered in discarded clothes .  But the most eye - catching feature will be a bed with two naked men .  Last week , Jarman had n't quite decided whether they were to talk to the	audience	or simply sleep through the exhibition 's four - day run although they 'll be allowed to get up for a pee and lunch , he added generously . By piercing hundreds of news - cuttings with barbed - wire ,  Jarman intends his most wounding attack on the tabloids '  attitude to homosexuality .  The cuttings date back to the beginning of the 1980s :  If you read these stories day by day ,  you simply do n't realise how many there are .	None
807	audience	3	Some football hooligans will be familiar with this one .  Nikki Milican jumps to their defence :  It 's  impossible to talk about performance art and not sound pretentious .

809	audience	2	THIS YEAR'S enthusiastically Francophile Dance Umbrella opened with one of the most prestigious of the French new - wave companies  Jean - Claude Gallotta 's  Groupe Emile Dubois .  Gallotta 's  whimsical approach receives heavy support in his own country .  But on Monday night the	audience	at the Queen Elizabeth Hall appeared neatly divided between those who were willing to prolong the applause indefinitely and those who either disappeared discreetly halfway through or scarpered quickly at the end . Gallotta 's  Mammame is true to a very French type ,  with its scatty logic ,  its mix of dance ,  gesture and slapstick and its ability to polarise opinion between joyously unconfined choreography and mildly diverting tosh .  By the end of 90 minutes I was close to the tosh school ,  but still buoyed up by the work 's  genuine pleasures ;  the unflagging force of its energy ,  the wit of its timing and the comic unlikeliness of some of its performers .

810	audience	2	By MARY FAGAN ,  Technology Correspondent BRITISH Pathe News Library ,  the film newsreel archive which chronicled world events of the last 100 years ,  has been acquired for 16m by Parkfield Group ,  the mini conglomerate .  Pathe , epitomised by its crowing cockerel and mildly patronising commentaries , stopped producing newsreels in 1970 after 75 years ' coverage of world events because of the decline of the film industry and a change in cinema	audience	tastes . But the library occupies an important position in British cinema history and includes unrivalled coverage of events ,  spanning Queen Victoria 's  diamond jubilee ,  the Wright brothers '  flight ,  the world wars and the onset of the space age .  Its footage is mainly licensed world - wide to film makers for inclusion in features and documentaries .	None
811	audience	3	By NICHOLAS FAITH THE LATEST rise in interest rates finally quashes the foolish delusion that Margaret Thatcher 's  economic policies were designed to help the entrepreneurial classes ,  for they need low ,  stable sources of credit .  In fact , her target	audience	has always been the unenterprising middle - classes , in big private companies as much as in the public sector , looking for security in the form of a home , a pensionable job and a company car . She has taken care not to touch any of these totally unentrepreneurial perks .  Mrs Thatcher 's  priorities were set before she became party leader .	None
812	audience	3	Letter :  Gallery view From Ms PHILIPPA TOOMEY Sir : When it comes to supporting the arts , very little seems to have changed since George Farquhar in his Discourse on Comedy described his	audience	in 1702 as : a pit full of City gentlemen , a gallery full of cits , a hundred ladies of court education and about 200 footmen of nice morality . It could be ,  of course ,  that these are the only people interested in the arts and it is a waste of time trying to increase the proportion of the modern equivalent of the footman of nice morality .  I write as a cit in the gallery .	None
813	audience	4	Scottish solicitors '  monopoly over conveyancing fees to be ended By MARK DOUGLAS HOME ,  Scottish Correspondent SCOTTISH solicitors ' monopoly over charging fees for conveyancing is to be ended and their rights of	audience	extended to Scotland 's supreme courts , the High Court and Court of Session . The changes are two of the principle proposals contained in a government policy paper on the Scottish legal system published yesterday .  Malcolm Rifkind ,  Secretary of State for Scotland ,  described the move as a modernising exercise .	None
814	audience	4	The present system ,  involving solicitors who put the interests of their clients first ,  was being replaced by a free market which will be a free - for - all among a handful of powerful ,  profit - motivated instititutions serving the financial interests of their shareholders .  Alan Johnston QC ,  treasurer of the 250 - strong Faculty of Advocates ,  said :  The disappearance of many small legal firms which rely on conveyancing income to underwrite the provision of other ,  non - profitable legal services will not be in the public interest .  The faculty also opposed the move to extend the rights of	audience	to suitably qualified solicitors , not to protect a monopoly , but because it felt the administration of justice might suffer . However ,  Mr Johnston was delighted by the Government 's  decision on lawyers '  partnerships ,  a view not shared by the Law Society of Scotland .  The Government plans to remove the statutory barrier to the formation of partnerships between solicitors and non - solicitors .	None

History is set out in apparently discouraging detail .	None

He which hath no stomach to this fight ,  let him depart .  At which , after an ovation , half the	audience	did depart to hear Michael Heseltine , whose idea of a fringe meeting is to hold it in the Grand Theatre , which is very grand , built 1906 , seats 1,200 , and where Alvin Stardust will head the bill in this year 's pantomime . Watched from above by proscenium cherubs ,  and in the spirit of One Nation first enunciated by Disraeli and all that ,  Michael Stardust held forth ,  he who walked out of the Cabinet and resigned .  He who also hopes for the leadership ,  but not yet ,  but still makes a speech fit for a leader .	None

The White Paper on changes to the Scottish legal profession published yesterday by Malcolm Rifkind ,  the Secretary of State for Scotland ,  says that once trained ,  Scottish solicitors should have unrestricted rights of audience in the higher courts ,  with the standard of performance achieved in training as the sole test .  Any rule directly or indirectly restricting solicitors '  freedom to undertake all the actions necessary for the preparation and presentation of cases will need the approval of both the Secretary of State and the Lord President of the Court of Session .

But in what the Law Society also interpreted yesterday as a clear shift in emphasis from the English proposals ,  the paper makes it clear that the role of the Lord President would be no different from the one he currently exercises when approving training and professional rules .  Under the English White Paper , rights of	audience	rules drawn up by the Law Society in conjunction with an advisory committee will be subject to the concurrence of four senior judges . The society fears that the Bar and judges will exert subtle pressure to build in case separation requirements .  The Master of the Rolls ,  Lord Donaldson ,  one of the four ,  told barristers recently that the interests of justice might require preparation and presentation of criminal ,  matrimonial and judicial review cases to be in separate hands .

820	audience	2	But Newley sings it in a way that personalises it .  I sing it practically every night of my life ,  because ,  like bits of Hamlet ,  it 's  so obvious that the trick is to go against the lyric and stir in your listener the real sense of a man who cannot love .  In the arrangement in my act , the song floats on top of a piano sonata : it 's the Brechtian thing of throwing responsibility for the sentiment to your	audience	. Before Stop The World ,  Newley was a rock'n'roller ,  spoofing Elvis in the film Idle On Parade .  But the parody was mistaken for the real thing ,  and the songs made the charts .	None
821	audience	2	At its start ,  a chorus figure  played with chipper authority by Joe Melia  -  strolls on stage and talks about the importance of remembering .  He is in ARP uniform ;  sirens wail and searchlights flicker .  But the memory lane he points the	audience	down is n't one that starts in Britain . Dragging open a curtain to reveal an advancing line of emaciated near - cadavers in filth - caked concentration camp uniforms ,  he takes you back to Auschwitz .  Here ,  as inmates with red - rimmed eyes and ash - grey faces barter items like a shirt or a spoon for half a bowl of soup ,  a nightmarish market economy is seen in operation .	None
822	audience	3	One of Suntory 's  products is whisky and Japan cannot get enough of the stuff .  They estimate an average annual consumption of 15 litres of whisky per head of the adult population .  Therefore it is only natural for the sponsors to indulge in a little nepotism and provide its Japanese	audience	with somebody they can identify with while they are enjoying a nightcap . Unfortunately Ohmachi could not sustain the connection and the rising son went down 8 and 6 on the Burma Road to Chip Beck in the first round yesterday .  Beck ,  unbeaten in the Ryder Cup with 3/12 ;  points out of four ,  is the sole American survivor in what is clearly a non - vintage field for this year 's  championship .	None
823	audience	2	Such religious/humanitarian subject - matter  even the Holocaust ,  Hiroshima and Aids have not escaped  makes a fortress as unassailable by criticism as the art produced under tyranny .  The worth of individual pieces is ,  obviously ,  very various ;  consistent is the appeal to piety ,  ensuring that the elevated theme produces a warm - hearted response .  These composers are not coldly exploiting their	audiences	' kindness ; they are all equally the victims of the going ideology . And sincerity is not in question .  But the hard truth ,  nailed with all - time accuracy by the other great composer from Leningrad  ( the one who got out )  is that sincerity does not guarantee quality .	None
824	audience	2	If anything ,  fashion is moving closer to the context of his style with the passage of time .  In the 1970s his language did indeed seem a little old - fashioned .  Now , as composers grope towards a language that satisfies	audiences	and yet manages to be sufficiently modern , Shostakovich 's music sounds at the front once again . There has been a welcome pile of new recordings issued recently ;  not just of the symphonies ,  but of the concertos and chamber music as well .  Two of them mark the start of international recording careers for extraordinary young Soviet pianists ,  Evgeny Kissin and Lilya Zilberstein ,  who were only children when Shostakovich died .	None

He made the most of his superb wind section ,  used the extra clarity of the strings to underline the richness of the harmony ,  and encouraged the brass to cut through the texture and pin down the rhythm as ,  for example ,  in the exhilarating chorus Achieved is the Glorious Work .

Different elements of the media perform different functions .  From what we know about their	audience	and their content , we would expect major differences between the influence of television and the influence of the press , and major differences also between the influence of highbrow and lowbrow sources . If they have any influence at all ,  different media sources should influence their audiences in different ways .  THE EXPECTED INFLUENCE OF TELEVISION	None
832	audience	3	Given those characteristics we should not expect BBC and ITV viewers to be influenced in different ways .  Whatever influence television news has on voters ,  it would be likely to affect all ,  or nearly all voters .  It would not affect different	audiences	in different ways . If we seek evidence of television 's  influence ,  we  should correlate general trends in public opinion with trends in the content of television news .  Moreover ,  despite its failings ,  British television is still very much an information medium rather than a propaganda medium .	None
833	audience	3	In the middle of the spectrum ,  however ,  are perceptions with more than a hint of approval or disapproval implicit in them :  perceptions of each party 's  electoral chances ;  perceptions of whether national economic performance and prospects are improving or declining ;  and images of the parties and party leaders .  It is not at all obvious whether viewing party leaders as energetic or decisive is a perception or an attitude .  To a foreign correspondent covering the British election for a foreign	audience	, whether a party leader appears energetic or decisive is simply a matter of objective reporting : a perception . To British voters ,  especially those who identify strongly with a political party ,   energetic or decisive probably imply approval :  for them ,  images are at the margin between perceptions and attitudes .  Media influence on perceptions is likely to depend upon whether they are at the pure perception end of the spectrum or at the margin between perceptions and attitudes .	None
834	audience	3	This chapter uses two techniques to investigate media influence .  To assess the impact of pervasive and consensual television news we can correlate trends in television news content and trends in overall public perceptions .

836	audience	3	It would give the viewer freedom of choice ,  even if that freedom was not extended to the broadcasters .  It might require public subsidies to political parties to finance their own newspapers and television stations .  Alternatively , rival parties could be given control of different public television stations : so BBC 1 and Channel 4 might become conservative - right wing channels while BBC 2 and ITV become socialist - left wing channels , which could then compete for an	audience	. The situation in some European countries approximates that model .  In Britain the idea of openly partisan broadcasting was pioneered by the Scottish Nationalists '  clandestine and illegal Radio Free Scotland in the 1960s and more recently by Southern Sound ,  who used a discarded former commercial radio band to set up their entirely open and legal Conference Radio FM to cover the 1990 Conservative Party Conference from an unashamedly pro - Conservative viewpoint .

The distribution speed of oral rumour was much quicker than that of newspapers , which from the guberniia capital of Voronezh ' Shafir calculated to be one verst for every four and a half hours.The chief stumbling block to a wider newspaper	audience	remained the high illiteracy rate . Shafir made a detailed study of comprehension levels by the supposedly literate .

The Oxford economists , Bacon and Eltis , found a receptive	audience	across the political spectrum for their diagnosis that Britain was generating far too few producers of wealth .

On reflection ,  however ,  this may not be quite true ,  since anyone who sets out to plant a wildlife garden instinctively takes a much keener interest in ,  and is influenced by ,  natural plant associations and communities .

859	bank	1	Most pilots have been shown the effect of gross over - ruddering during their basic training .  The following demonstration compares a stall with a little too much rudder to a stall in a slightly slipping turn ,  and shows how even slightly too much rudder has a significant effect at the stall .  Start to circle in a normal turn with about 20 of	bank	, keeping the yaw string exactly in the middle while you reduce speed very gradually . ( On most types of training glider it will be possible to get down to the pre - stall buffet and continue with either a slight rocking of the wings or a very gentle inner wingdrop .  )  Keep the rudder where it is and allow the speed to increase a few knots so that both you and the student can observe the exact position of the rudder pedals .	None
860	bank	1	Most beginners will find it difficult to apply the opposite rudder ,  because of their ingrained habit of using the stick and the rudder in co - ordination .  It is also surprisingly difficult to hold accurate heading during a full airbrake sideslipping approach .  You need to be familiar with the type of glider you are flying because each needs slightly different angles of	bank	and behaves differently when side - slipping . Many types have a pot pitot in the nose and the ASI indicates a false reading during side - slip .  On some ,  the rudder overbalances badly and there is a bad trim change .	None
861	bank	1	Many types have a pot pitot in the nose and the ASI indicates a false reading during side - slip .  On some ,  the rudder overbalances badly and there is a bad trim change .  Most only need a small angle of	bank	, as the rudders on gliders are not very powerful . Normally you will want to use full side - slip for a few seconds rather than a small amount of slip for a much longer time .  Provided that the need of slipping is spotted straight away ,  it should never be necessary to side - slip close to the ground .	None
862	bank	1	Provided that the need of slipping is spotted straight away ,  it should never be necessary to side - slip close to the ground .  The slip is used just to get rid of the excess height so that less than full airbrake is required for the rest of the approach .  With most gliders , the easiest way to enter a side - slip and to hold the heading is to freeze the rudder central while applying the	bank	. Provided the approach path was correct beforehand ,  the adverse yaw as the aileron is applied swings the nose off to just about the right point to keep the glider on the correct path .  The opposite rudder is then applied to hold that nose direction and to prevent the glider from turning .	None
863	bank	1	Provided the approach path was correct beforehand ,  the adverse yaw as the aileron is applied swings the nose off to just about the right point to keep the glider on the correct path .  The opposite rudder is then applied to hold that nose direction and to prevent the glider from turning .  Most beginners apply the opposite rudder too harshly and this makes it difficult to hold the	bank	constant . It is easiest at first to limit the rudder movement to half or three quarters of the full deflection and to start by applying the banking movement just before applying the rudder .  By all means practise side - slipping at height ,  but do n't assume that because you can do it at height you will be able to do it accurately on an approach .	None
864	bank	1	Attempt this in a gentle turn as well ,  and in a gentle turn with a little too much rudder .  This time it will almost certainly drop a wing ,  but just easing forwards a little will make a recovery .  Try some very steep turns and then some with about 40 of	bank	; try reversing the turn quickly , and making little centring moves . Of course ,  if there are thermals about ,  do all this in the lift ,  provided there are no other gliders sharing your thermal !  You should be able to go into turns and make centring movements without having to refer to the slip ball ,  yaw string ,  or ASI .	None
865	bank	1	This is a matter of constantly exploring out a few yards on almost every circle to try to find the best possible area of lift .  Frequently this involves turning steeply at low speed to keep the radius of turn to a minimum and to make use of the narrow cores of lift .  Remember , thermal soaring is more about staying in the strongest area of lift than flying at an efficient angle of	bank	; it usually pays to turn steeply , as the small turning circle enables you to keep in the narrow cores of strong lift . If flying across country is not practical and you are local soaring ,  it is better to practise moving from cloud to cloud or thermal to thermal without taking the climbs to any great height .  For example ,  on a day with a 3000 foot cloud base ,  climb to 2500 feet on the first climb ,  then fly off leaving that thermal ,  using the airbrakes if necessary to come down to try to find another one at 2000 feet .	None
866	bank	1	Then do the same  on an easterly or westerly heading .  Also try changing speeds .  You will discover large errors flying near north or south with even small amounts of	bank	, and large errors on east and west if you vary the speed . Compass errors are an awful nuisance and it is well worth finding out a little about them .  You also need to become accustomed to thinking and using degrees ,  and deciding whether you need to turn left or right to change the heading .	None

The chteau of Chalais has been a stronghold of the Talleyrands from that day to this ,  and when Pound in recent years read about Napoleon 's  grand chamberlain ,  notably in the memoirs of Madame de Rmusat  ( a principal source for Canto 101 )  ,  this new association with Chalais re - activated his memories of that place ,  which accordingly is named afresh ,  bringing Aubeterre with it ,  but in a quite different tone and spirit from to set here the roads of France .

Although the near - monopoly enjoyed by solicitors was indefensible because it related only to the preparation of documents ,  there is a real need for consumer protection and I am far from sure that the White Paper proposals meet this need ,  he said .

927	bank	3	In a statement issued with Andre Benard ,  his French counterpart ,  Mr Morton said he believed agreement could be reached in time to put a fresh financial package in place by early next year .  This would involve raising an extra 1.2bn to 1.6bn .  Of this , 25 per cent would come from a share issue in 1990 or 1991 and new	bank	borrowings . However ,  a number of essential differences between Eurotunnel and Transmanche Link need to be resolved .  These include agreement on curbing the cost of terminals and equipment  where the contactors '  estimate is 382m higher than that of Eurotunnel .	None
928	bank	3	Both ,  however ,  want the right to process Switch transactions on behalf of their retail clients .  The catalyst is the Government 's  decision in August to uphold a recommendation from the Monopolies and Mergers Commission that the credit card networks Visa International and Mastercard should alter one of their membership rules .  This rule , still in existence while Visa and Mastercard fight a rearguard action with the Office of Fair Trading , prevents	banks	from processing card transactions until they have built up a large base of card - holders . Now Lloyds and Barclays argue that the debit card network should bow to the same principle  and that they should be allowed to process Switch transactions without first issuing Switch cards to their account - holders .  Switch is likely to resist any such application .	None
929	bank	3	By FRANK KANE ,  Chief City Reporter THE 13.5bn takeover battle for BAT affected the reputations and fees of all the City 's  big merchant banks in the first nine months of 1989 ,  according to figures announced yesterday by the magazine Acquisitions Monthly .

The most notable inclusions in the list were Lazard Brothers and Hambros ,  which rose from eleventh to second place and nineteenth to third place respectively .  The last time Hambros was so well placed was in 1986 when it advised on another mega - bid ,  by Hanson for Imperial Group .	None

Sharelink has built up a clientele of about 57,000 in two years .  The commission structure is a significant improvement on pre - Big Bang charges at a minimum of 16 and a rate of 1.25 per cent on the first 2,500 of a transaction ,  falling to 0.75 per cent for the next 2,500 and 0.2 per cent thereafter .	None
1026	bank	3	Not surprisingly ,  the 3,000 users of the service average 8,000 when they deal .  This compares with an average transaction level of under 1,900 at Sharelink .  The leading share service offered by the high street	banks	is Barclayshare , which offers both an execution - only facility and a portfolio management service . The transaction service costs 20 a year ,  charged in two instalments .  On top of this there is a charge for every transaction of a minimum 16 ,  with 1.25 per cent on the first 5,000 ,  0.75 per cent on the next 10,000 ,  and 0.5 per cent applying thereafter subject to an overall maximum charge of 250 .

1027	bank	3	The saving on interest rate costs by taking out a foreign currency mortgage is obvious enough  about 5 per cent to 6 per cent .  The big pitfall is the prospect of a currency loss if sterling declines still further ,  which can wipe out the benefit of interest rate savings and leave the borrower owing more debt than he borrowed in the first place .  Because of this , foreign currency mortgages , which are being sold very heavily at the moment by financial intermediaries ( linked to	banks	and other financial institutions which are providing the funds ) , are only for the financially sophisticated . There are ways of hedging against the exchange rate risk .  One method is to switch the foreign currency loan back into sterling if you think that sterling will weaken significantly  more than a possibility .	None
1028	bank	3	The best known include John Charcol which has Kleinwort Benson ,  the merchant bank ,  as its loan provider ,  and PG Associates ,  part of the London  Manchester Group ,  which offers Ecu loans .  London  Capital ,  which is linked to UCB ,  the French - owned mortgage company ,  provides a comprehensive foreign currency mortgage service for UK and overseas properties .  Behind the intermediaries are British	banks	, and British and Scottish insurance companies . Their rationale for entry to this flourishing new market is easy to understand .  With the UK housing market flat ,  and with competition high ,  business generated by foreign currency mortgages can generate a higher turn for the lender than UK mortgages ,  and produce extra fees and commissions for the intermediary arranging the facility .

1030	bank	3	But for those with loans over 30,000 where there is no tax relief ,  it is certainly worth considering paying off some of the mortgage  -  particularly since there is no clear indication of when rates might come down. But if it is bad news for borrowers ,  investors have never had it so good .  Returns of 12 per cent and more are on offer from	banks	and building societies while the rate of inflation even taking into account this latest mortgage rate rise is around 7.5 per cent . Investors are getting a real return of 4.5 per cent on their cash .  This looks like the best return available on income bonds but investors should move fast as these offers tend to be fully subscribed very quickly .	None

Later in the day the shelling ceased so Taff and I were able to get his kit together and make our way through the village to the farm and No. 6 Commando positions .  I left Taff at the entrance to the farm and watched him as he continued along the road then , as he clambered up the grass	bank	and disappeared among the trees , I turned into the farm . There was a lot of activity in the area of the farm buildings ,  people dashing about even though the farm was being heavily mortared .

The guns a short distance away along the river	bank	were shelling the German positions as I started up the bagpipes in a fairly secluded thicket , the sound of the drones and the pipe reed easily drowning the noise of the guns . From the thicket I could see the bridge and to my amazement I could see Commandos marching in file across the bridge and coming slowly towards me ,  a few of them looking and pointing in my direction .  Stopping the pipes and stepping out on the footpath at the side of the river I walked towards the Green Berets .	None
1039	bank	5	We ate the fish and polished off some cider while we watched the bombers blasting Caen ,  the British guns along the Orne joining in for good measure .  Twenty - eighth June  this evening I joined the Marine Commandos to take part in a night standing patrol .  These patrols had to be very careful owing to the close proximity of the German positions and the difficult countryside of high hedges and tall earth	banks	with trees on top . The heavily wooded area was criss - crossed with tracks ,  some leading to farm buildings ,  others leading to a barn in a clearing of corn ,  the whole scene ,  particularly at night ,  required vigilance as the enemy had mined the well - worn tracks .  Many of the German mines were most unusual .	None

The sunken road leading into the orchard was full of wounded ,  mainly German ,  with a few British and French Commandos being attended to by a French medic .  The wounded German Officer was carried up the grassy	bank	and placed against a tree . He was still conscious and was moaning loudly ,  his head moving from side to side .  I tried to make him as comfortable as possible and with the assistance of a French Commando placed a shell dressing into the large wound in his back .	None
1041	bank	5	The German Officer was now obviously dead .  There was blood pouring down his face from a head wound ,  he had slipped from his sitting position and was now lying on his side ,  his knees drawn up.

I was not surprised to learn that the shelling of our positions was not the German guns but the British guns  ( the bastards )  .

His name was Charlie Mears ;  he was the only son of his mother who was a widow ,  and he lived in the north of London ,  coming into the City every day to work in a bank .  The widowed mother , the residence in north London , and the daily travel to work in the London	bank	were all pad of Eliot 's own experience at the time of the composition of most of The Waste Land .

1055	bank	2	This vision ,  what Eliot called Kipling 's  knowledge of the things which are underneath ,  and of the things which are beyond the frontier ,  ,  was what made some of Kipling 's  short stories so important to the writer of The Waste Land  .  It was like Frazer 's  looking into the abysm of time ,  but it was a vision only imperfectly appreciated by Charlie Mears ,  as the narrator of The Finest Story in the World emphasizes :  Above all ,  he was absolutely ignorant of the knowledge sold to me for five pounds ;  and he would retain that ignorance ,  for bank - clerks do not understand metempsychosis ,  and a sound commercial education does not include Greek .  To find its most lasting realization , Charlie 's vision would have to wait for a bank clerk who did understand metempsychosis , and who had not only a commercial education gained in an underground room at Lloyds	Bank	, but also a knowledge of Greek . The Waste Land 's   tone would be grimmer ,  throbbing between two lives .  But when such a bank clerk followed Charlie ,  Rudyard Kipling entered The Waste Land  .	None

In a paragraph whose subtitle , City , City , harks back to The Waste Land , he expressed astonishment that in an economic slump the City was pulling down buildings to erect ever more splendid	banks	. Eliot was fond of familiar details of a London which ,  in a sense ,  he had known all his life ,  ever since the childhood reading of Sherlock Holmes which he recalled in 1929 .

Contrary to declarations that there was no government policy for sterling and that it would be left to the markets to decide ,  by late 1981 the government intervened to reverse a fall in the exchange rate ,  and raised base rate to 16 per cent .  It did the same again in January 1985 ; when the pound fell to 1.12	banks	were instructed to raise interest rates by 1.5 per cent .

There were fundamental differences between these two government departments  between two ministers  and Westland was piggy - in - the - middle ,  which was a very costly and unfortunate experience .  The important issue for me as chairman throughout that period was to remember that once the Prime Minister had said that Westland was a private - sector problem which must be solved by private - sector measures and techniques , one 's interests were obviously the shareholders , the employees , the customers and the	banks	, since the company was heavily indebted . One was not then justified in thinking and functioning in terms of what might be in the national interest ,  what might ultimately be a desirable development for NATO strategy or defence strategy .  It was rather a more specific and harsher problem which ,  to put it bluntly ,  was to survive as Westland was drifting on to the rocks of insolvency .	None
1069	bank	3	What was interesting about that was that at the time John Brown got into financial difficulties the banks and institutional shareholders took a tough but very constructive view that it was worth helping the company through a reconstruction rather than forcing it into liquidation ,  which had been an attitude prevalent some years earlier .  It was in fact my experience of working with the banks and institutions for the recapitalisation and reconstruction of John Brown which led me to think that the City is much maligned over its attitudes to industry and the accusation of short - termism is not justified .  The institutions and	banks	had been immensely supportive in helping save the company .

1073	bank	3	The gap between the willingness to lend and the capacity to receive is partly due to the fact that the majority of donors have country lending ,  or granting ,  targets .  The staff members they deploy in the field to identify projects are under pressure from their senior management to turn such targets into reality .  Working within an embassy office or the regional office of a multilateral	bank	it is not difficult for donors ' staff to come up with a list of potential projects which can be presented to a recipient country 's ministry of finance for discussion . Overworked officials in finance ministries rarely reject a whole list of potential projects ;  they are much more likely to identify a few priorities at random ,  and pass on the donor to the line ministry ,  hoping for the best if and when the project is financed .  Once a project is on a donor 's  priority list it takes on a life of its own ,  and may become unstoppable .	None

She showed them the small lake in its ring of reeds , took them to the first slopes of the mountain , rigged up a fishing rod for Michael and took him to the part of the lake she used to fish as a girl , and soon he was shouting out in glee as he missed the ravenous little perch or swung them out over his head on to the	bank	. Rose 's  mother showed the girls the house and the fowl and farm animals ,  including a pet goat who would n't let Rose milk her unless she sprayed herself with a perfume that the mother used .  They were given a sumptuous tea and invited back any time they felt like coming .	None

The pike slowly took line off the spool ,  I struck and then a 15 minute fight began ,  said David ,  15 ,  from Fyfield ,  near Abingdon .  It took me three attempts to land the fish but eventually I managed to bring it in to the	bank	and my mate Paul scooped the net under it . I was amazed ,  it 's  the biggest pike I 've ever caught ,  said David who legered his trout bait on a size 8 hook to a 20 lb trace and 10 lb line .  James Rainbow fished his first ever pike session last week and caught the fish of a lifetime  a beauty of 24 lb 8 oz.	None
1081	bank	6	For instance ,  the frost levels are critical .  Apart from the brief cold spell in late November ,  we have had very few hard frosts .  This is good news , because now water levels all over the country are rising so fast , it means the	banks	will be spared from the scouring effects of a hard winter . This is also good for fly life in the coming season ,  all those eggs are now safely under a protecting layer of water .  Prolonged cold spells on reasonably full lakes are not a bad thing .	None
1082	bank	6	Few lakes or reservoirs start to warm up until late March ,  and the deeper ones are normally cold well into May .  The shallow bays may be a degree or two warmer ,  and are always the first place to look in the early days ,  but the deeps will stay cold until real strength returns to the sun .  Fish normally seek out the warmer shallows , and if there are a few days of sunshine before opening day then you will know where to choose on the	bank	. At the moment ,  most reservoirs are filling fast .  In November and December last year the water tables across the land were depleted ,  but the majority have now been replenished .	None
1083	bank	6	I predict with some confidence that Chew and Blagdon will be at top levels for the start of the 1991 angling year .  The newly - flooded margins will be attractive to the fish in the first few days ,  until the sudden influx of size ten waders make them wary .  The great thing about having the lakes at top level is there is so much	bank	to choose from , and we are almost spoilt for choice . This is not the case when the level is even just a few feet down. For my money it can rain as much as it likes in the coming weeks .	None

Both the two - rig landing bays had moved into the banks on the centreline , and their combined crews , assisted by the ubiquitous	bank	support section , had connected the anchor ropes and the short ramp sections , Which were added to the main ramps to allow traffic easy access to the bridge . The Troop Staff Sergeant detailed to supervise the construction was insistently calling the rafts into the head of the bridge ,  where they coupled on with remarkable rapidity .  The end of the bridge was clearly visible as it grew out of the far bank ,  and needed only a couple of rafts to make it complete .	None

1113	degree	0	Academies of art ,  whether in the West or in the Orient ,  have had lists of priorities in themes of art ,  in which there are many similarities .

1114	degree	0	Commemorative figures in city squares ,  portrait busts ,  tomb or cemetery furniture have also been traditionally restricted by the terms of commissions .  A consequence of this tradition is that the sculptor 's  own personality may receive less prominence in a monograph than a painter 's  ,  as the effect of patronage given or withheld can be decisive in a sculptor 's  career .  The other major role of the sculptor is in the service of religion , where a high	degree	of interplay between artist and patron is not necessarily so important , making the sculptor 's situation into one which is more like the painter 's . Writing on Auguste Rodin can make the point .  According to George Heard Hamilton ,  Rodin became a figure of international significance ,  the most admired ,  prolific ,  and influential sculptor since Bernini .	None
1115	degree	0	Part of the reason for this is that the American professoriat is the largest in the world ,  while the American market for current art is unprecedented ;  it is evident that the turnover of the American art market as a whole is the largest in the world .  The persuasive tax advantages for the rich to contribute works of art to public collections also play a part ,  contributing a measure of prestige shared between artists and the powerful in society .  Critics can also be invested with a	degree	of respect deriving partly from their academic connections . Another sort of authority derives from money ,  which a reader of art criticism may find it difficult to dissociate from an object .  Historical knowledge is the surest cure for this damaged intellectual condition ,  as the history of taste will show many examples of the irrelevance of monetary value to artistic quality .	None

Don't be daunted by that ,  but recognise that like everything else in the acting business ,  it is highly competitive .  No drama school panel is looking for the ultimate in audition technique but candidates should possess a noticeable	degree	of competence and self - awareness .

1118	degree	0	If you have done any class work before attempting the drama school audition ,  most of the teachers will at some point in their sessions have talked about relaxation .

1120	degree	0	In the South ,  the marginality of the third main political party ,  the Irish Labour Party ,  is an indication of just how successful the articulation of capitalism to religious and national beliefs is .  The South is not a classless society ,  but its class nature has been well hidden in consciousness and dominated by the procedures of the capitalist - democratic process .  Despite the principal duality of Irish party political power , the bourgeois structure of the state has rarely been questioned , only the	degree	of state intervention in the bourgeois economy . Also ,  the clerical church has been particularly antipathetic to socialism in any form .  It showed itself to have a horror of socialism already in the nineteenth century .	None
1121	degree	0	The Religious Component of Catholic Nationalism There is nothing theoretically which hinders religion being an ingredient ,  or even predominating in the nationalist mix .

In the case of Irish nationalism a specific relationship with catholicism has been formulated .	None
1122	degree	0	Catholic morality approves of the view that to repel an aggressor is to engage in a just war .  It just so happens that Irish national  popular consciousness interprets the presence of the British state in Ireland as a form of aggression and hence feel justified in repelling the British from Ireland .  Catholic morality also approves of a proportionate	degree	of violence to overthrow tyranny .

1124	degree	0	A dislike by Irish clerics for such an explicit and direct church  state relationship has a long tradition and comes out best in De Tocqueville 's   ( 1957 )  conversations with Irish clergy on his visit to Ireland in 1834 .  When asked if they would like subventions from the state to aid their stipends and church buildings ,  a move which was being seriously considered by the British government at the time ,  priests and bishops were united in rejecting the idea on the grounds that it would drive a wedge between clergy and people ,  identifying clergy with the principal enemies of the people .  De Tocqueville 's notes reveal not only the conscious opposition to such a mode of religious power but also how deep the solidarity between clergy and people was , the	degree	to which the poor , half the catholic population at the time , looked to the clergy for material and spiritual leadership , guidance , and assistance , and how much they trusted them . However ,  with the emergence of the Southern Irish state ,  it soon became clear that this secularization of the state form was not to signify an absence of Roman catholic power in the construction of public morality ,  but rather an indirect recognition of the sovereignty of the church in most areas of moral concern besides education .  In fact ,  precisely because Roman catholic power was to be accepted as normative in an entirely natural way by the catholic  nationalist population ,  the church 's  part - active and part - passive  acceptance of the capitalist system of government and thorough opposition to socialism had a significant legitimating function for the Irish state - form .	None
1125	degree	0	This monopoly position is therefore totally beyond criticism .  One might speculate that an impending solution to the Northern Ireland problem would split off from the clerical leadership those groups for whom the present position is only accepted on pragmatic grounds .  Hence the traditional alliance between catholicism and nationalism might be split at the popular basis with the ensuing growth of a	degree	of anti - clericalism . However ,  as the very existence of the catholic  nationalist alliance impedes progress towards such a solution ,  one should perhaps view such a possibility as unreal .  The Roman catholic leadership in Ireland has first to change and radically evaluate its monopoly beliefs ,  thus permitting the dissolution of one of the most antagonistic aspects of catholic  nationalist hegemony .	None
1126	degree	0	Some catholic nationalists in the South mix with a proportionally much larger number of Southern protestants who ,  however ,  are loyal to the Southern state .  Part of the reason why Roman catholics go to their own schools is because they believe they are obliged to do so .  The belief is to some	degree	affected by being told so by their authoritative pastors . It has even been described as a fundamental moral precept by more than one Irish catholic cleric :  The law of the Church is quite definite ,  quite universal in this matter .

1127	degree	0	The pressure to remodel old pubs is of course nothing new .  The Victorian and Edwardian eras witnessed many wholesale rebuildings of modest Georgian drinking - houses ;  during the Interwar period even more money was pumped into enlarging and rebuilding old pubs ,  as well as in creating large new ones  ( see Alan Powers '  essay below )  .  However , alterations were more often than not effected with some	degree	of sympathy for the existing fabric and atmosphere . With the advent of postwar Modernism much of this sympathy evaporated .  The ascetic modernists '  rejection of history in order to create a visionary brave New World was clearly incompatible with the historic pub .	None
1128	degree	0	Both these establishments seem to have had an architectural form very similar to the ordinary domestic buildings of their area ,  and the hall provided the communal eating and drinking space .  The tavern was a meeting place ,  usually in the centre of the town or village ,  where wine was normally served .  According to John Earle , writing in 1628 , the inn was a superior establishment to the alehouses and was a	degree	or ( if you will ) a pair of stairs above an alehouse , where men are drunk with more credit and apology . The alehouse in its most basic form was simply a domestic building where ale was sold to generate additional income for the household ,  although David Lupton observed in 1632 that the alehouse keeper  defies a wine tavern as an upstart outlandish fellow ,  and suspects the wine to be poisoned .

1134	degree	6	It exists largely as a product of the institutions of higher education  ( Sarsby 1984 :  132 )  and has only recently begun to surface in policy and practice .  As Okely  ( 1987 :  67 )  observes ,  the urge to create publications is not always as crucial to others as it is to the academic .  Indeed for those insiders living in Cheater 's metaphorical front room such as in the police the need to obscure and seek a	degree	of anonymity from the analytic gaze can be described as a major principle in the preservation of power , ranking highly in the structures of significance . Yet there are those of us who ,  although firmly based inside such an institution ,  have undertaken anthropological training and have  subsequently developed the academic wish to be discursive .  Our interpretation of the field situation therefore becomes a specific and unusual type of anthropology at home ,  for it is not out there in the exotic or even in the backyard .	None

Inspectors can no longer hide behind a paper managing a desk  ( quote from a Chief Superintendent )  .  Then again for reasons of established cultural preference we had to go back to the Audit Commission and ask them to translate 6.358 million into real men ,  for we had difficulty in trying to sell such an alien concept to the police mind .

He spoke revealingly about the problems he had had with jurisprudence ,  bemoaning the fact that it was ambivalent and undefined ,  concerned primarily with the ambiguity which sustains the anthropologist by revealing the centralities of a system :  it was all grey areas ;  no black and white certainties or decisions ;  no precedent or case law giving the definitive interpretation .  At the Police Staff College shortly before I was offered the scholarship to university , I had listened as lists of	degrees	obtained by previous scholars were read out . The majority were for law and were greeted by applause in an assembly of the staff and students .  Later on ,  however ,  the names of those who had graduated in the social sciences and especially sociology were greeted with hissing disparagement and barely concealed denigration .	None

Moreover ,  he must come to terms with a new awareness of what he has previously accepted ,  perhaps without thinking ,  which under the intense microscope of social enquiry may well seem to verge on the ludicrous or to be morally indefensible .  And having long been supported by the institution he will be crucially aware that it expects a	degree	of loyalty verging on deference or acquiescence . In such an archetypal world ,  where good is constantly and insecurely balanced in an eternal struggle against evil ,  the  objective explication of the rituals and symbols which surround and mystify police work can seem tantamount to a treasonable act .  In 1979 ,  James Anderton ,  the Christian moralist chief constable of Greater Manchester ,  described the greatest threat to law and order as stemming from seditionist interested groups who do not have the well - being of this country at heart and who mean to undermine democracy  ( Thompson 1979 :  380 )  .

1138	degree	3	It would be paradoxical for them to be in the vanguard of social change ,  for as Templeton  ( 1980 )  points out ,  they are there to preserve the structure ;  to uphold the state of play .  But there are a few who are  questioning the  state of play ,  and who agree with Ben Whitaker  ( 1979 :  312 )  when he urged that police thinking would profit if it more often came out of its shell and concerned itself with wider questions about the role of the police and human relations .  However , this is not always easy to achieve , as I found out when I first returned to work in 1977 after my	degree	course . In order to continue postgraduate studies I had applied for some financial assistance for part - time fees ,  under a scheme created by the Home Office and set up specifically in recognition of a lack of higher educational qualifications in the police service  ( HO Circular 29/74 )  .  This directive encourages officers to research and study in their own time and lists suitable subjects ,  which include public administration ,  management studies ,  economics ,  law ,  criminology ,  social sciences ,  youth work ,  English language and literature and relevant modern languages .

The circular goes on to point out that the list is not exhaustive and suggests other courses may be appropriate .  I had applied to continue full - time research following my	degree	course , but this had been turned down by my chief officers ; however , I had been told that assistance for part - time study would almost certainly be approved in view of the national policy of encouraging officers to extend their educational qualifications . I then found my application for financial assistance for part - time study had been rejected because anthropology is not on the approved list of subjects  ( in the Circular )   ( Memo from HQ 1977 )  .  Eventually I was able to convince my senior officers that anthropology was  one of the social sciences ,  perhaps only because I somewhat sardonically returned a memo which asked why ,  if anthropology is not approved ,  have I just been allowed to read the subject on a Bramshill Scholarship ,  on full pay and allowances 	None

Smith  ( ibid .  157 )  also touches on the crucial feeling of potentiality which the university experience can produce in the individual ,  but which the police are generally unable to incorporate .  Yet another inspector returning to Leicester with a	degree	in psychology was set to work in the force vehicle store counting tyres . Like many graduates stimulated by their experiences ,  he discovered that although he had been of sufficient calibre to acquire the offer of the scholarship in the first place ,  he now faced the inevitable service obsession with a rejection of academic prowess in preference for practical skills in the real world  ( ibid .  157 )  :  the greatest problem with the current working of the scheme appears to relate to re - entry into the Service	None
1141	degree	3	It would ,  of course ,  have revealed some aspects of the variable world of police culture to the outside and this was unacceptable .  Another writer on the police met similar problems when he wished to write and publish .  I had discussed the problems of insider analysis with him at a 1988 Police Conference , where he described how , on return to his force after his undergraduate	degree	, he had asked for permission to publish research material . His request was refused in a written memo from HQ ,  but no reason was given .  Unwilling to accept this constraint ,  he went on to ask why not    ( again in written report )  and was informed reasons were never given ;  the official line was simply to refuse all such requests .	None
1142	degree	3	Indeed ,  the fact that he had apparently used an editor from a Manchester newspaper for some of his purposes was latched onto and quoted as a sign that he was suspect and disloyal .  One consequence of these modes of thought is that the service has to live out a continuous and enormous paradox .  Even at the same time as it publicly commends higher education , seeking out the graduate entrant , spending large sums on publicity to this end , and funding access to	degree	courses on scholarships , it also holds to a central ethic of distrust of the academic . Whitaker  ( 1979 :  229 )  clearly understands the way this rejection of training and education operates within the service :  at present good recruits often have to be chased to Bramshill on the lengthy command courses ,  because chief constables are not anxious to spare able men ,  and officers themselves are reluctant to be separated from their families and homes ,  as well as having a fear that they might lose from being out of sight ,  out of mind for promotion .	None
1143	degree	1	Furthermore ,  such pressures are limited ,  thus creating a situation where there has been hardly any research on the police compared with the large output of critical scholarship on industry ,  commerce ,  the civil service ,  the health service and education what little direct research there has been on the police has scarcely begun to ask such fundamental questions as what is the police force and what is it doing .  This point ( Wojtas 1982 ) occurs in a description of a new research centre for Police Studies at Strathclyde University , which is to ask whether anyone is doing research on the police , what	degree	of co - operation they have met and to encourage research by the police themselves . Once again ,  however ,  defensiveness won the day and when the Strathclyde Centre circulated forces asking them to co - operate in the venture ,  a decision was taken to withhold co - operation and a circular went round to this effect ,  suggesting the existing Home Office funded PRSU  ( Police Research Services  Unit )  and the Home Office Research and Planning Unit were adequate for the needs of the service .  This latter unit  ( formerly the HO Research Unit )  does provide some research material for those who seek it out and its bulletin is a reference source to recent government funded research ,  which is largely concerned with operational systems and the tools of policing .	None
1144	degree	3	The conference was also told that as an alternative to the expense of sending officers to university ,  it was proposed to  direct  officers to research a particular problem and give them a short period to carry out intensive research .  The emphasis on directed research is mine and indicates the reduced potential for any ethnographic sedition ,  for which force would seek to direct officers to the critical analysis of its subcultural idiosyncrasies   Furthermore , such short periods of directed research can be shown favourably as a saving over any extended	degree	course in the budgets . The emphasis of this directed  ( or controlled   )  research ,  it was announced ,  is to be on pragmatic ,  problem - solving enquiries  ( i.e. policy - orientated research )  ,  which ,  it was explained ,  would be of cost - effective advantage to the force .  There seems to be little chance of any philosophical ,  unprogrammatic enquiry here which might be critical of the system ;  and no espionage from within !	None
1145	degree	6	It is the marker of force and hence continues to sustain the continuing paradox of police force  police service which remains unresolved ,  on which I will say more later in relation to the role of women police officers .  The dark uniform we wore had a military cap with polished brim ,  and in our fashioned tunics of soft serge and shiny boots we presented an avenging image ,  clothed in the symbolic colour of death and darkness .  Black is a light absorbent , non - reflective colour and most suitable for controllers who operate with a	degree	of social anonymity , upholding the rule of law and the abstractions of the legal system . In such a world ,  individuality is never a prized characteristic ,  and an attempt in the early 1980s to remove the one remaining individualizing feature  the shoulder numeral or collar number  was correctly rejected by civilians as a structural move towards an even greater anonymity .  As Reiner  ( 1980 )  suggested ,  the riot gear in which the police are increasingly seen ,  with shields ,  visored helmets ,  knee - length boots ,  and flame - proof overalls ,  enhances their avenging appearance .

1146	degree	0	The detective on the other hand ,  immediately sets out to reduce these culturally created separations ,  for he needs to negotiate a statistical reality with the dirty prig opposition .  The real polis is programmed to maintain a conceptual purity by maintaining structural distance ,  while the detective ,  of necessity ,  is forced to reduce this to carry out his deal with the dirt .  By reducing the social space between the dichotomies of ordered law enforcers and uncontrolled prigs , the detective necessarily returns a	degree	of humanity to the prig which the uniform collar feeler is always structured to deny . The lowly polis ,  with little or no power in the system ,  deplores this situation and complains of its escalation ,  while the detectives moan about the incompetence of the uniform wollies who never get close enough to their prisoners to extract their own coughs or admissions and who fail to understand that the system largely depends on the ability of the department to manipulate a statistical norm in detected crimes .

Obviously ,  each kind of experience necessarily contains elements of the other. Thus , there is some	degree	of selfdetermination in the ship case because we are free to shut our eyes , to cross the river and see it move from right to left , free to jump into the water and watch it coming towards us , free to determine the speed with which it passes across our visual field by moving our eyes with or against its movement . In the house example ,  we can choose the order in which we see the parts of the building but we surely cannot see occluded portions ,  and we surely cannot look up to see a thatched roof  because that 's  the kind of roof we want to see  when the roof is tiled .  In fact ,  in every microsecond of perceptual experience there is a tension between the real as refractory ,  as something we cannot choose or will ,  and the subjective as chosen and willed .	None
1151	degree	0	Scientific measurements may correct ,  reform or at least question individual unaided observations but there cannot be a systematic ,  universal discrepancy .  The cash value of scientific observations in this context must therefore be based upon subjective experience and cannot be greater than the cash value of the  latter ;  for it is subjective experience that ,  ultimately ,  validates our objective scales of energy intensity .  We may use physical methods of measuring light intensity that are apparently independent of our subjective experience for instance photosensitive cells but these are accepted because they correlate to a greater or lesser	degree	, under normal circumstances , with subjective experiences of brightness . If there were simply no correlation whatsoever between the electrical output of a photo - electric cell and some other measure of light intensity directly or indirectly related to experience ,  it would not have been accepted as a way of measuring light intensity .  However indirectly related to sensory experience a laboratory quantification of a particular form of energy may be ,  in the end the rate of exchange between one form of energy and another  the way in which we compare the quantity of one with the quantity of another  -  reposes upon the gold standard of subjectivity .

The impact was twofold .  The sharp decline in business activity severely reduced the volume of full - fare first - class ticket sales while the increase in unemployment and interest rates curtailed to a drastic	degree	levels of disposable income available for leisure purposes such as optional standard - class rail journeys . This loss of optional travel was also exacerbated by the intensified competition from longdistance coaches following the liberalisation of route licensing in the 1980 Transport Act .  Given the choice in such circumstances ,  many of InterCity 's  customers on low or fixed incomes  in particular students and senior citizens  preferred the cheaper but slower coach option .	None
1154	degree	0	An important feature of the 1980s which has contributed to InterCity 's  financial turnround is market segmentation and pricing  or the shaping of products to meet the needs of customer groupings .  Essentially this concept is not new  from the early days our railways were providing first -  ,  secondand even third - class accommodation and the excursion ticket was quickly used to sell spare capacity .  What is new is the much greater	degree	of sophistication which is now necessary to produce the maximum revenue yield from each and every InterCity journey .

Even the ever - ebullient Sir Peter Parker saw parts of the commuter system rattling into decline ,  and nobody was surprised when in 1979 the government referred the services to the Monopolies  Mergers Commission. The Commission 's report was perhaps the turning point , for while it paid respect to the management it found to be totally dedicated to the railway with a high	degree	of pride in the service which came before financial reward in importance , it made thought - provoking recommendations about management style and the need to set clearer financial objectives .

1156	degree	1	Through the late 1980s another force was at work which turned the Provincial sector 's  fortunes further round .  Increasing prosperity in the United Kingdom meant that people had more spare cash ,  and much of this was spent on an increase in personal travel .

The further division of Railfreight into five subsectors , namely Coal , Construction , Petroleum , Metals and Distribution , has exposed the strengths and weaknesses of individual traffic flows and kept the	degree	of cross - subsidy within the sector to a minimum . All the way through Railfreight 's  emergence as a viable ,  forward - looking concern ,  the emphasis was on improving the service to the customer .

Not that the eighties were without their problems : quite apart from the industrial recession of the early years , which affected all Railfreight 's bulk traffics to some	degree	or other , there was the historic miners ' strike of 19845 , taking heavy toll of steel as well as coal carryings . Happily the coal traffic was revived to the point where pre - strike tonnages were exceeded ,  although the number of individual collieries served was vastly reduced .

1169	degree	4	This problem can be eliminated by ,  for instance ,  producing a bus bar with a range of slot spacings or doping the fibre to produce a slight spread of magnetic field period .  This effectively spreads out the resonance peak  ( which at a steady temperature is very sharp )  ,  and produces strong coupling at a range of temperatures .   Measuring current with light : Danny McStay ( left ) and Welland Chu harness Faraday rotation to vary the	degree	of coupling between a pair of optical fibres carrying polarised light . This has obvious implications for making floating current measurements in high voltage distribution systems .  The inset picture shows a slotted bus - bar for use with the optical sensor .	None
1170	degree	0	Bakhtin is unusual among literary critics in making the focus of his activity the novel rather than lyric poetry or drama .  In practice ,  binary oppositions are very liable to favour one term at the expense of the other ,  and there can be no doubt that Bakhtin preferred the dialogic to the monologic  ( a bias that is evident in everyday English ,  where to engage in dialogue is good ,  and to utter a monologue is rather bad )  .  This emphasis made the so - called monologic forms of literature problematical , and Lodge quotes from an interesting late essay by Bakhtin which seems to suggest that all literary discourse is to some	degree	dialogic . To remove the distinction completely would seem to undermine the insights that had given force to Bakhtin 's  earlier criticism .  Lodge suggests that this need not happen ,  if one sees the monologic and dialogic as dominant tendencies rather than mutually exclusive terms .	None
1171	degree	3	That shared culture has gone ,  though its traces have persisted for a long time ,  at least among those unworldly older academics who assume that students of English will have read the whole of Shakespeare in the sixth form ,  or that they can readily identify classical or biblical references .  The belated realization that these things are no longer so leads to the embittered and baffled reaction that they ought  to be so .  However , that is a declining reaction ; the experience of regularly interviewing would - be entrants to an English	degree	course soon induces a sense of realism . In the state of affairs that still obtained when I entered the profession in 1959 the grammar school teacher and the university teacher of English were not radically different kinds of person ;  indeed ,  contingent or accidental factors might have determined which career path was followed .  Since then there has been a marked divergence between school and university ;  students have become less well equipped ,  and academics ,  particularly young ones ,  have become more high - powered ,  ambitious ,  and professionalised .

1172	degree	3	In the 1980s ,  following on government cuts in finance ,  British universities have been engaged in a desperate scramble for overseas students and the more - or - less economic fees they are required to pay .  It is an undignified business ,  but survival demands it .  Higher	degrees	in English are an obvious target for foreign students who have been trained in the subject in their own country , and who wish to obtain a doctoral qualification in an anglophone university before themselves becoming teachers . The university welcomes them as a source of income ;  some students are funded  by their own governments to obtain a doctorate and enter public service .  There is ,  in one way ,  an admirable balance of supply and demand ,  and some applicants are good by any standards .	None
1173	degree	3	In such cases failure is even more painful than with a home student ,  and one has heard rumours of failed candidates having to return several years of fees to their government ,  and suffering even worse penalties .  The problems are not universal ,  one must emphasize .  Some students , particularly those from the Indian subcontinent who have been selected for Commonwealth Scholarships , are capable of performing very well at higher	degree	level , and then returning to an academic career in their own countries . When overseas students do present difficulties  and I am sure many academics will be familiar with distressing or scandalous cases  it is not because they are lacking in industry or intellectual ability .  Many of them would do perfectly well in disciplines which are less idiosyncratic than English and have a more obvious international currency ,  like linguistics or economics or marketing .	None
1174	degree	0	Many of them would do perfectly well in disciplines which are less idiosyncratic than English and have a more obvious international currency ,  like linguistics or economics or marketing .  But in this respect ,  at least ,  English in the English academy ,  as Leavis liked to emphasize ,  is not just another subject .  It expresses a mystique , is to a high	degree	culture - specific , can seem elusive , and is not easily reduced to the rules and agreed procedures of other disciplines . It is not just overseas graduate students who have problems .  We must all have known home undergraduates who have worked very hard on an English course ,  who may be ambitious to do well ,  and who still ,  to their intense disappointment ,  end up doing badly .	None
1175	degree	3	I like Graff 's  proposals ,  but they seem to me utopian .  They might work in the graduate school of a good American university ,  where a variety of methods already abounds .  I cannot see how they could be established in British literary education , where there are no graduate schools as such , and the narrow , uphill tunnel of A - level work leads on to the rocky , cloudy uplands of the undergraduate	degree	, with its confused mixture of practical criticism and thematic study , analysis and literary history , coverage and special subjects . Undergraduates of moderate ability do not much like being asked to choose between differing judgements on the same text ;  I can imagine them becoming confused and resentful if they were asked to choose between different critical approaches and all their attendant ideological baggage .  Certainly ,  I have known some undergraduates who would rise brilliantly to such a challenge ;  but they are an exception ,  and one cannot base a course on what would suit the exceptional student ,  much as one would like to .	None
1176	degree	3	There would be no fixed canon ,  and no coverage .  Such a degree course would not suit everyone ,  but it might well be attractive to the late entrants and mature students who are increasingly common participants in higher education ,  particularly in the humanities ,  and who bring valuable experience of life and work to their study ,  but may have rather little formal preparation .  It would also be more appropriate for the unambitious students of moderate talents who currently apply for an English	degree	, but would be more at home in a less intensive programme of liberal study . Cultural Studies would provide a more productive environment for the radical aca - English Departments ,  who have conspicuous energy and intelligence ,  but little literary sensibility or aesthetic interests .  Literature ,  when taught in such a context ,  would ,  no doubt ,  be given a culturalist and contextualist treatment ,  and I believe that there is nothing inherently objectionable about this .	None
1177	degree	3	The other part of my proposal will probably prove annoying to radicals ,  thereby ensuring a proper balance .  If Cultural Studies goes its own way ,  what happens to what is left   I would certainly not favour a rump version of one of the current forms of English	degree	, with their recurring arguments about canons and coverage , the definition of literature , and the place of theory . Instead ,  I propose taking the logic of generic concentration as far as it can go ,  with a degree which would study ,  in detail ,  a single genre ,  poetry .

1182	degree	3	I prefer not to call this creative writing ,  since the late - Romantic ideological implications of creative are irrelevant ,  even undesirable .  The intention is that students of elaborate structures in language should be able to construct them as well as receive and consume them ,  if only to achieve a better understanding of how poems are made .  Something of the sort has already been introduced into some English	degrees	, under the aegis of the Verbal Arts Association , who have made a welcome start with such work . The reading of English poetry would be accompanied by a consideration of historical as well as current theories of poetry .  These would include the arguments of the major poet - critics of the past :  Sidney ,  Jonson ,  Dryden ,  Johnson ,  and on to the Romantics ,  Victorians ,  and modernists .	None
1183	degree	3	There is an element of utopianism in drafting such proposals ,  though I believe these ideas are worth pursuing .

It might well appeal to poets or would - be poets ,  who ,  contrary to popular myths about inspiration ,  are usually keenly interested in the technical aspects of composition .  What I have proposed in the foregoing pages is a conscious surrender to the culturalists of much of the activity that now goes on in English	degrees	, in order to retain something more coherent , defensible , and inherently valuable . Culturalists will point out  as C. S. Lewis once did  that much poetry of the past was not written for aesthetic ends ,  but for religious ,   political ,  or other social purposes .  This is true ;  but such poems have outlived their original purposes and now survive as aesthetic entities .	None
1186	degree	3	But a restatement of that ancient affinity should strengthen poetry against political and culturalist claims .  The academic study of music may be a specialist field ,  but music ,  of every kind ,  is widely diffused and performed ;  only a small percentage of those attending concerts or recitals will have taken degrees in music .  Similarly , one would like to see a state of affairs in which many more people read and enjoyed poetry than had taken a	degree	in it . The degree in poetry I have outlined would attempt to be open about its theoretical assumptions .  I do not believe there is any absolute virtue in such openness ,  in fact ,  I think that education is ideally carried on in a shared form of life where there is agreement about fundamentals and attention can be concentrated on the task in hand .	None
1187	degree	3	In the 1950s ,  it seemed as if there might be a place for literature in the academy ,  so that the writing of fiction or poetry ,  of criticism ,  and the teaching of literature would become a unified form of life .  As we know ,  it did not happen .  Thirty years on , English is a large and entrenched subject , and there is no likelihood of putting the clock back , and starting again in some other way : my proposal for a division between Cultural Studies and a	degree	in poetry is a pragmatic proposal for a way out of current difficulties . Other factors ,  like the institutional need to advance knowledge ,  to publish ,  to engage in research ,  and generate performanceindicators ,  would remain ,  whatever new academic structures emerged .  There is ,  however ,  another way in which a useful advance might be made .	None

This is not to propose Christianity as a counter - ideology .  There can be no Christian blueprint for the final form of society , since it is part of its perception of the human condition that all forms of society are provisional , reflecting human sinfulness , though not always to an equal	degree	. It does ,  however ,  have a missionary vision of what it means to be truly human ,  derived partly from rational reflection on human capacities and desires ,  but supremely from its conviction that we glimpse true humanity in the life ,  death and teaching of Jesus .

Martial law ,  capable of preserving order but not reversing economic decline ,  in turn yields to semi - pluralism as the principle of the party 's  monopoly of power is jettisoned to create a national consensus behind measures to salvage the country 's  economy .  Army rule and multi - party democracy are , to an almost equal	degree	, anathema to the Soviet party leadership , Mikhail Gorbachev included . Moreover the Politburo can argue both that political pluralism is no panacea for economic problems ,  and that it is much easier to apply in Poland than in the vast multi - ethnic Soviet empire .

1234	degree	0	While there are studies of the RUC 's  role in security and public - order issues  ( Brewer et al  .  1988 :  4784 ;  Enloe 1978 ;  Pockrass 1986 ;  Weitzer 1985 ,  1986 ,  1987 a ,  b )   ,  this forms only part of RUC duties ,  given the special position of Northern Ireland among divided societies .  Primarily , however , an empirically based study of public order policing is impossible to undertake in the midst of the province 's continuing violent conflict , and certainly could not be done with the	degree	of depth , empirical focus , familiarity , and , frankly , personal safety which an ethnographic study of routine policing allows . Nor would such a study have been given permission by the RUC ,  for it is utopian to expect police authorities in divided societies to open up these sections of their force to scrutiny and observation by outsiders .  An analysis of routine policing at least allows the possibility of empirical research being undertaken on police forces operating in divided societies ,  which is itself important because studies in the sociology of policing focus almost exclusively on police forces in stable liberal democracies .	None
1235	degree	0	And ,  further ,  in areas like Easton ,  where there is very little crime related to the troubles ,  the police do not on the whole develop the attitude that law and order is a battle between the RUC and Catholics .  This encourages a balanced view of Catholics ,  something which ,  as we shall emphasize in later chapters ,  can be absent amongst some policemen beleaguered behind their reinforced stations in areas of high tension and conflict .  A final point worth making in defence of the data is that the observational material cannot be impugned to the same	degree	, because in the flow of action during an incident the exigencies of the situation usually take over , making it difficult for policemen and women to act in ways contrary to what the situation requires or their colleagues demand . Hence many extracts from the data used in this volume are near - verbatim records of natural conversations in reallife settings .  While on the whole we feel knowledge of the field - worker 's  religion was not detrimental to the research ,  we believe it also had positive effects ,  in that it immediately forced respondents to confront their attitudes towards Catholics ,  as did the field - worker 's  gender in relation to sex roles in the force ,  placing both issues high on the research agenda .

1241	degree	0	ln addition we used voters '  degree of preference for their first - choice party  ( over their second choice )  as yet another potential influence upon their ratings of the media 's  usefulness .  The main influences on usefulness - ratings were people 's  interest in politics and their motivations for following the campaign .  Their	degree	of preference for one party Over others had an important influence upon the usefulness - ratings they gave the media for helping them decide how to Vote ( those with clear preferences found the media less useful for that purpose ) but had little or no influence on other aspects of usefulness - ratings . Surprisingly ,  perceptions of bias never had a significant impact on usefulness - ratings .

1242	degree	0	But the factors influencing ratings given to television for helping people decide how to Vote were different .  Once again ,  motivations were a key factor but it was vote - guidance seekers ,  not information seekers ,  who now rated television most highly .

1243	degree	0	Television scored best on helping people decide how to Vote if they found politics interesting during the campaign but had lacked a general interest in politics in the mid - term .

Ratings of radio news were less predictable than ratings of television but they too were influenced by recent political interest , motivations for following the campaign , and	degree	of party preference .

1244	degree	0	Third ,  the press is partisan ,  biased ,  and proud of it .  The press always has been a medium of propaganda as well as a medium of information .

In the final 1987 election campaign the press became more partisan and its emphasis on propaganda increased .  The tabloids in particular carried relatively little in - depth information but a lot of propaganda .	None
1245	degree	0	This time sequence is conclusive .  Television bias was not the cause of declining expectations of Alliance success :  it was a consequence of declining expectations amongst both journalists and the public at large  ( Table 7.3 )  .     Relative coverage of Labour and Conservative was always biased towards the Conservative government but the	degree	of bias increased sharply ( it tripled ) in the fourth week of the campaign . Yet public perceptions of Conservative chances of victory sank to a minimum in that fourth week and assessments of Labour chances reached a peak then .

1246	degree	0	By those measures of visibility ,  national politicians were much more visible than local candidates from the start .  Indeed ,  Kinnock and Thatcher were more visible in our pre - campaign week ,  when both were on highly publicized foreign tours ,  than they   were during the campaign itself .  Their	degree	of visibility was also more predictable than the visibility of local candidates , though their visibility became less predictable as the election approached . Before the campaign opened those who were particularly interested in politics were very much more aware of Thatcher 's  and Kinnock 's  recent activities .  By the end of the campaign that was no longer so true .	None
1247	degree	0	The conceptual distinction between perceptions and attitudes is clear ;  but perceptions of party chances or the state of the economy imply an element of approval or disapproval when articulated by the electorate .  ( They are purely objective perceptions when articulated by political scientists or professional economists ,  of course .  )  These perceptions were influenced in varying	degrees	, though not completely determined , by partisan loyalties . As the election approached ,  perceptions about party chances of victory became more homogeneous :  most voters thought Conservative chances were good and Alliance chances were poor .  Perceptions of Labour chances remained more predictable ,  though they too became rather more homogeneous as the campaign came to an end .	None
1248	degree	0	Overall television fulfilled its public service role of informing the electorate ,  and did so particularly well as the election drew closer ;  while the press fulfilled its self - assigned role as pamphleteers within a libertarian system ,  and did so with increasing effect as the election drew closer .   PRESCRIPTIONS Supporters of the Libertarian Ideal must be pleased by the	degree	of public satisfaction with the press despite public perceptions of press bias . Indeed they must be pleased by the traces of evidence that suggest that bias in a freely chosen medium such as a newspaper is actually popular with the electorate rather than resented .  Similarly they must be pleased by the traces of evidence that suggest partisan voters find the relative impartiality of television news somewhat irritating .	None
1249	degree	0	The concept of a national centre has been a hierarchical mental device used by historians since the Reformation to over - simplify the chaos of diverse local stimuli .

1252	degree	0	The partial compensation found in the fertility of the black and brown immigrants of the Commonwealth countries who had sent over 3 million people into Britain since 1962 did not meet with universal enthusiasm ,  as the evidence from the Race Relations Board frequently suggested .  Afro - Caribbeans huddled in ghetto areas like Brixton or Southall .  Non - white Britons were having a growing impact , notably in mass sport and entertainment ; commercial advertisements to an increasing	degree	focused on a poly - ethnic consumer market . But only an enlightened few saw this as a symbol of national renewal .  In the face of this varied sense of internal malaise ,  the return of the Thatcher government ,  with its young - Turk generation of monetarists and entrepreneurs ,  marked at least a change of gear ,  even if the privatization of publicly - owned enterprises was a very minor feature of the Conservative manifesto in 1979 .

1253	degree	3	The real essence of Thatcherism ,  indeed ,  lay not so much in its ideas ,  which proved to be increasingly malleable as the years went by ,  and especially when Nigel Lawson took over the Treasury in  1984 .  It lay rather in the company it kept ,  the classes with which it was associated .  As noted , Mrs Thatcher came from a relatively humble , unprivileged background , though a	degree	at Oxford and later marriage to a millionaire businessman gave her a distinctly haut bourgeois status in time . But her outlook was subtly different ,  say from that of Edward Heath ,  whose father was a carpenter in a small town in Kent and who ,  like Mrs Thatcher ,  went to a local grammar school rather than the private boarding schools favoured by most Tory leaders .  The Heath background was one of constructive ,  but deferential ,  working - class Toryism .	None

In his place at the Treasury came the younger ,  almost reckless ,  figure of Nigel Lawson ,  an able former financial journalist and apparently still a nominal enthusiast for monetarism .  To an increasing	degree	, the government and its outlying establishments bore the Prime Minister 's stamp ; her press secretary , Bernard Ingham , seemed more powerful than most Cabinet ministers , somewhat on the pattern of Lloyd George 's use of Bronco Bill Sutherland in 191822 .

1255	degree	0	Indeed ,  Fleet Street itself was a misnomer from 1985 onwards ,  as modern technology and high unit costs led major newspapers to move out of central London to the eastern inner suburbs ,  to avoid the unions '  stranglehold .  The long ,  sometimes violent ,  dispute with the print unions over the relocation of The Times  plant at Wapping marked a notable step both in the new financial and technological independence of the press and its ideological separateness from the union - corporate approach of the past .  The Church of England was also , to some	degree	, a victim of the Thatcherite attempt at hegemony . The Church had continued to lose members in the 1970s and 1980s ,  yet it remained a powerful source of social criticism .  Its 1985 report on the inner cities ,  Faith in the City  ,  was attacked by government ministers for its allegedly Marxist inspiration .	None
1256	degree	0	For decades ,  as the Royal Commission on Wealth and Income demonstrated in the late 1970s ,  those disparities were modified by the social benefits available under the welfare state .  By the end of the 1980s ,  partly as a result of deliberate government action ,  more perhaps because the unduly optimistic assumptions of Beveridge and other founders of the British welfare system were being falsified by financial and cultural factors  ( such as the breakdown of the old nuclear family of fabled tradition )  ,  the welfare state was far less able to temper the asperities of a harsh and divided society .  The beleaguered ranks of social workers and investigators of the 1980s documented a society more unsettled , more helpless , and to some	degree	more violent than at any period since the century began . Finally ,  there was constant angst  about Britain 's  world role .  The direction of Britain 's  post - imperial policy was unclear after 1945 .	None

1259	degree	0	When a considerable proportion of the industry is working competitively for the market ,  the inducement to employees and employers to introduce and operate incentive schemes will be greatly strengthened .  Experience in the past two and a half years has shown both the general effectiveness of such schemes and the need for a much wider extension of them .  Finally , in location , size and amenities , the private builder ( including to a large	degree	the housing association ) necessarily builds to suit his customers and thus provides an index of demand . The distortions which occur under a system of all but exclusively local authority house - building  the tendency to conform to the past rather than the future location of population  ( with consequent immobilisation of labour )  ,  the wrong proportion of houses of different sizes ,  and the provision of more amenities than those for which tenants are prepared to pay the economic price  these will naturally correct themselves when private building is restored .  To combat the opposite extreme of jerry - building ,  we would make membership of the Housebuilders '  Registration Council 's  register compulsory upon all contractors for local authority houses ,  with a view to rendering the building industry eventually an industry subject throughout to publicly - approved standards .

It was thus a revolution in British fiscal policy which Chamberlain advocated in the name of Empire ;  and from his Birmingham speech in May 1903 until he was struck down three years later his advocacy of tariff reform and his Imperial theme dominated British policies .  Yet the Imperial side of the argument  whatever view may be taken of the fiscal ,  economic and domestic  would not stand up to examination .	None

1268	degree	0	Mrs Thatcher has been fortunate in that retirements of several senior personnel in the early 1980s gave her the opportunity to influence promotions ;  there were thirteen appointments as Permanent Secretary in 1982 alone and she has had a hand in appointing the great majority of Permanent and Assistant Permanent Secretaries since 1979 .  The traditional trade - off for the secure tenure of senior British civil servants has been that they are anonymous and politically impartial .  To some	degree	the impartiality has depended on there being a large measure of policy agreement and continuity between the parties in government . The doubts of some pre - war Labour leaders that the civil service would actually co - operate with a radical Labour government were largely laid to rest by the experience of the Attlee government .  But radicals in both parties who favoured radical changes ,  either to the left or to the right ,  have frequently condemned the civil service as the embodiment of an above - party consensus favouring continuity of policy .

The Conservatives ' desperation to devise a counter - programme for the land , and the disagreements it provoked , demonstrate the	degree	of confusion which still existed in the Conservative ranks and the immense problems they still faced before the rampant omnibus of the Great War rescued them by running down their opponents . It is a pity that Fforde 's  determination to present the Conservative party as decided individualists prevented him from exploring the confusion in the Conservative ranks indicated by his evidence .

1273	degree	0	In concentrating all matrimonial legislation in a new secular High Court in London ,  the Act also represented the success of common and equity lawyers in capturing full control of matrimonial litigation .  To explain the nature of legal change Stone offers a model that suggests first ,  that clients revealed the gap between current values and the law ;  second ,  that this was followed by the attempt of lawyers and judges to narrow the gap ,  often by inventing legal fictions or effectively changing the law by judicial re - interpretation  ( the changing definition of legal cruelty provides one example of this )  ;  and third ,  that all this culminated eventually in legal change when the level of duplicity and hypocrisy became intolerable to law lords and legislators alike  ( pp. 1920 )  .  This model , which echoes that used by Oliver MacDonagh to explain the growth in nineteenth century government , relies on a high	degree	of consonance in the wishes of lawyers and their clients , a not unreasonable assumption given the limited access to divorce in Stone 's period . But it is not a model that holds up for the twentieth century ,  when liberalization of the divorce law was not a matter of last resort but was rather always proposed as a means of strengthening the institution of marriage  ( by permitting those living in sin to remarry )  ;  when opinion shifted with dramatic speed ,  for example between the conservative recommendations of the 1956 Royal Commission on Divorce and the endorsement of profound liberalization given a mere ten years later by both the Law Commission and the Church of England ;  and when the change in views of key institutions such as the Church of England were as important as those of lawyers .  The permission given by the 1969 Act for no - fault divorce was driven as much by a profound rethinking of the sources of morality by clerical and academic opinion as by the determined pursuit of individual self - interest on the part of either the population at large or lawyers in particular .

In the four general elections held since independence the turnover of MPs has been as much as 50 per cent .  In contrast the authoritarian nature of Tanzanian politics can more usefully be measured by the number of political detainees which exceeded several hundred in the mid 1970s or in terms of the	degree	of pressure brought to bear on the rural population from 1974 to 1978 .

The development of the system spanned more than twenty years and achieved a	degree	of success in terms of its defined objectives .

This argument is partly valid in the African context :  Mutang'ang'i was periodically obliged to remove his metal cutting machines from his worksite in Nairobi .  On the other hand , a systematic survey by the International Labour Organization has shown that , in a sample of ten African countries , 40 per cent of informal sector enterprises pay some form of tax or registration fee , implying a	degree	of recognition by government . By the late 1980s no African government could afford to neglect the significance of the sector for the employment of the hundreds of thousands of primary and secondary school leavers who were joining the labour market each year ,  and most were making policy statements which indicated some support for it .

In the same year the Swiss scholar ,  J. J.

This idea was accepted with varying	degrees	of caution by many nineteenth - century anthropologists and ultimately was wholly endorsed by Engels , who , in the preface to the fourth edition of The Origin of the Family , Private Property and the State , gave warm praise to Bachofen . Bachofen and Maine were soon followed by J. F. McLennan ,  a Scotsman whose work in part coincided with that of Bachofen and Maine but which developed much more the study of kinship systems .

It will have been noted that the rhythms of body temperature and alertness are timed very similarly with higher values in the daytime and lower values at night  ( compare figs 1.2 and 1.3 )  .  This means that a higher body temperature is associated with a higher	degree	of alertness or a smaller amount of fatigue . The detailed explanation of what makes us feel alert is not known ,  but it is certain to be some function of brain activity ,  and brain activity increases with body temperature .  This is because enzymes  ( proteins that are responsible for carrying out the chemical processes within the body )  act more quickly as the temperature is raised .	None

Many drugs are acidic or alkaline and this affects their removal in the urine ;  acidic drugs are excreted more easily in the daytime and alkaline ones at night .

The building owner may either employ a builder to carry out the work or opening up and eradication ,  or he may call in one of the numerous specialist firms to deal with the attack .  If a builder is entrusted with the work , it must be ensured through a full briefing and careful supervision that only conscientious , knowledgeable and skilled tradesmen are employed who are able to give rational advice on the proper nature and extent of the remedial treatment if the initial assessment of the	degree	of damage proves to be inaccurate . The advantage of employing a specialist firm is that its tradesmen are more likely to be well trained and experienced in this field of building preservation ,  with a thorough and successful job being a more certain result .  However ,  it should be clear that any firm which issues a guarantee must inevitably err on the side of over - zealousness ,  which will add to expense .	None

1315	degree	0	Cinema developed alongside the wireless and the telephone as communications media that would change the way people perceived the world around them .  It is doubtful ,  however ,  whether these filmmaking pioneers had any sense at all of the new invention 's  potential significance .  They may have felt a	degree	of excitement as they turned their cameras on a train arriving at a station , waves crashing on the beach , or a group of workers emerging from their daily grind in the factory , but these early pieces of reportage were seen as nothing more than animated photographs , a further step in the development of photography . A little later ,  as filmmakers began to expend the medium 's  storytelling capacities ,  they drew from the techniques developed for the magic lantern or diorama and audiences saw a woman interrupting her husband in the act of kissing the maid ,  or a miller grappling with chimney sweeps in front of a windmill .

Woolf ,  a shrewd film salesman who had played a key role in financing the first projects of both Balcon and Wilcox .  The re - editing he demanded has generally been taken as evidence of just that Wardour Street backwardness to which Kine Weekly  alluded .  But while it 's true that Woolf 's disapproval of the film 's distinctive angles and extreme lighting contrasts does betray a	degree	of conservatism and , in his later campaign against The Man who Knew Too Much ( 1934 ) , he was clearly the enemy of anything even moderately original , Woolf was not a simple philistine . Brunel ,  no less committed than Hitchcock to an artistic direction for British films ,  was later unstinting in his praise of a man who by his faith and support set the pace at a time when we most needed it and credited him with contributing very considerably to the renaissance of the British film production industry .  Given that the re - editing of the film reduced the number of title cards from 300 to 80 ,  it is reasonable to assume that Woolf 's  intervention considerably improved the film ,  and that Woolf 's  commercial experience provided a valuable lesson both for Hitchcock and Balcon .

Hindus have long fled the rural parts of Punjab ;  now some Sikhs are joining the exodus ,  disgusted by terrorist excesses that led to 3,787 deaths last year and about 1,500 so far this year .  The militants are split between	degrees	of intransigence , which could make them vulnerable at the polls . Some have called for a boycott of the elections ,  but most are likely to back the faction of the Akali Dal ,  the Sikh political party ,  led by a former police officer ,  Simranjit Singh Mann .  Mr Mann insists that Punjab must be a homeland for the Sikhs ,  brought into being by a UN - supervised plebiscite .	None
1352	degree	3	Blacks need to realise that affirmative action cannot solve their most serious problems ,  whites need to remember that affirmative action does not make it an advantage to be born black .  Two bad ideas clutter the debate .

It is true that it would not prevent the mortgagee taking possession , though it made his position in some	degree	uncomfortable if he did take possession .

1356	degree	1	Moreover ,  there seems to be nothing artificial in principle in holding the acts of an employee done in the course of his employment as equivalent to the acts of the employer .  These principles ,  are ,  however ,  applied in different degrees in the respective spheres of Criminal and Civil Law .  A man is not punishable for a serious crime committed by another unless he has actually instigated the commission of a crime , and then he will be punishable though the crime committed may differ in some	degree	from that which he instigated . It may be noted that in Criminal Law anyone who aids ,  counsels ,  or procures the commission of an offence is liable to be tried and punished in the same way as if he were a principal offender .  But in the case of minor offences ,  and especially statutory offences ,  which are anti - social rather than immoral ,  a man may be punished even for the unauthorized act or default of one in his employment .

1358	degree	3	According to his professor ,  he was thorough and conscientious rather than brilliant ,  taking his studies very seriously since he wanted both to improve himself and gain a qualification for when he finished playing .  It was during his second year at Manchester that he was offered the West Indies captaincy for the visit by Pakistan ,  but decided that his studies had to come first ;  he had a strong sense of predestination and apparently felt that the leadership would be his eventually .  Completing his	degree	would ensure that he was better equipped to do the job , especially as by studying social anthropology he would be better able to understand his players . Yet had the visitors been England or Australia he may well not have been able to resist the  temptation ,  and this was only partly because they were the leading lights in world cricket ;  there was also the racial aspect ,  in that he passionately wanted to prove that a team of black players led by a black captain was the equal of ,  if not better than ,  the white teams .  No doubt it is difficult for young people now to appreciate the complexities and the rigidities of the social structure in colonial days.	None

This alloy is naturally silvery in colour and is much more hard - wearing than a thin layer of tinning , but it requires a high	degree	of skill to control the casting conditions .

1369	difference	1	A RULE OF THUMB It will by now have become evident that this book takes an unorthodox approach to art criticism .  There will be no attempt to define exactly what art criticism is , or to set out a theory of criticism , beyond the suggestions of some	differences	in writings on art which have already been made . Nor will a history of art criticism be attempted .  The stress of the book falls on a viewer 's  encounter with a work of art ,  and how a prior reading of a piece of art criticism can improve that encounter .	None

1371	difference	4	Does an English liking for watercolour spring from the country 's  climate   Does the flat landscape of the Netherlands impose a special sort of vision on Dutch artists   The reverse of the coin is internationalism , a feature , some might say , of twentieth - century art ; not so uncommon either in other periods , where art historians struggle heroically to identify	differences	between the art of one country and another . Some of these struggles have been inspired by base motives  desires to appropriate art to a national or a political cause .  But some such efforts can have sympathy ,  as in those stirrings of national spirit in central Europe before 1914 ,  when literature ,  language and music were fuel for Czech ,  Polish or Hungarian aspirations .	None
1372	difference	2	Dictionaries describe a monograph as an account of a single subject ;  by this definition monographs make up one of the most common categories of art publishing .  A book on a single painter ,  for example ,  is a monograph .  There is some doubt in a grey area of	differences	between monographs on the one hand , and catalogues or biographies on the other. For convenience ,  biographies will be included in the present chapter ,  while catalogues will be treated in the next .

1373	difference	0	Max Friedlander ,  an outstanding scholar of Northern European art ,  took the view that accepting a work into an artist 's  oeuvre was like recognising a friend ,  not a matter of measurement or detailed scrutiny .  The reader is thus relying on Friedlander 's  eye .  A	difference	between Morelli and Friedlander is that the former explains his method , while the latter does not. More than a hundred years have passed since Morelli started writing ;  in that time many problems of authorship have been solved ,  while about others tacit agreement has been reached .  The results of this process can be read in detail in catalogues raisonns ,  which often give a blow - by - blow account of the arguments of scholars over the years .	None
1374	difference	3	A case of unwitting collusion by a critic in a manoeuvre by an art  dealer occurred in 1961 ,  when Leo Steinberg wrote an article about Jasper Johns .  Johns was a puzzling phenomenon for Steinberg ,  as one of the artists of Pop Art ,  then hardly begun .  The article appeared in an Italian magazine Metro , who had intended to pay 300 for an article ; but when Johns ' dealer , Leo Castelli , knew that Steinberg was considering an article , he arranged for the magazine to offer 1,000 , paying the	difference	of 700 himself . Steinberg knew nothing about it .  The underlying question for a reader of criticism is what influences are exerted on the critic ;  but as in this instance ,  for long it may be impossible to know the truth .	None
1375	difference	0	It is not altogether satisfactory to call a print by an artist on the same theme as one of his paintings a description .  After all ,  it is an original work in itself .  Nevertheless , the	differences	between painting and print may be instructive , and help the interpretation of both .

There remains the courtesy paid by one art to another ,  as in the poem which Baudelaire suggested might be a high form of critical writing .	None

In addressing itself to such possibilities ,  however ,  A Bend in the River  ,  for all its air of simplicity ,  is never simple .  Its narrator and chief human presence is by no means straightforwardly a victim , and the	difference	between oppressor and oppressed can be hard to identify . The novel is narrated by a Moslem of Indian origin ,  whose family has been settled on the east coast of Africa ,  as traders .  Salim leaves them ,  takes off on the first of a series of flights ,  and treks to the interior ,  to a country which appears to be compounded of the Congo and of Uganda ,  in order to earn a living from a store which he has acquired from a man whose daughter he is expected to marry one day .

But the fit of jealousy in which he beats her would appear to mean something more than these words of explanation enable one to understand .  This jealousy may be felt to be like Othello 's in having more to do with	difference	of race , and with the jealousies of race , than the jealous man , or than the work he belongs to , seems disposed to state .

But in The Emperor no detail is adduced that might bring out what	differences	there could have been between the courtiers and petitioners of Ethiopia and their counterparts elsewhere in the world . Kapuscinski 's  courtiers and petitioners are about as black as Johnson 's  Prince Rasselas ,  who is about as black as he is white .

The	difference	between an author who tells and an author who shows , and who employs a medley of voices in order to do so . It is a distinction which may in the end prove more suggestive than serviceable :  the author who tells ,  and who can be accounted something of a ventriloquist ,  may well ,  for instance ,  be more than capable of carnival ,  and may even be every bit as plural in his works as his dialogic counterpart .  But it is possible to believe that the idea of ventriloquism which lies at the heart of it may be successfully applied both to some sorts of contemporary author and to some of what went before .	None
1381	difference	0	Nathan Zuckerman is a persona 's  persona :  Roth begat Peter Tarnopol  who begat Nathan Zuckerman  in the novel of 1974 ,  My Life as a Man  .  Zuckerman has enabled Roth to deal with the question of the offence he has given to righteous Jews ,  and to come to terms with the rebellious ,  psychedelic ,  philo - Semitic Sixties ,  when Roth 's  writing went ,  with the times ,  derisive and fantastic .  The Zuckerman books are a medley of	differences	and affinities between what we are able to infer about Roth 's life and what he has made of it in art . In propria persona  ,  Roth discourses in The Facts  about his relationship with his younger brother ,  Sandy .  The tone is judicious and kind .	None

No one would lightly believe that either of them has ever found it hard to tell the	difference	between himself and somebody else . Dualistic explanations are moving ,  and intriguing :  but they are often thought ,  even by proponents ,  to be far - fetched ,  fictional ,  theoretical ,  counter - intuitive .  That Bellow ,  this participant in Roth 's  inner life ,  can also be said to be out there in the world as his friend ,  and perhaps his rival ,  is a fact which does not help one to decide whether or not to trust the reports of literary duality  what comes in has to have been out  but it is very much in the tradition .

Whether or not she has talked to God ,  she has certainly been reviewing for him. Levi , the expert on metals , would have had no difficulty in telling the	difference	between gold and tin . I have heard that he was saddened by these writings of Fernanda Eberstadt 's  ,  in which his own writings are faulted .  Two months after the Herling piece was published Levi committed suicide ,  throwing himself down the staircase of the house in Turin where he was born and grew up ,  where he wrote about his life in the camp at a desk which stood where his cradle had stood ,  a house he shared with his wife and mother .

1384	difference	0	Levi 's  double life as chemist and writer suggests that if art and work need to be separated ,  according to a certain sense of what it is to be a Jew ,  art and work are nevertheless very often the same .  I like to think that he would have accepted that art is work ,  that the work that frees us ,  and is not just punishment ,  is art ,  and that anyone who uses his imagination is an artist .  The categorical	difference	of the modern world , between artists and others , does not come well out of his reports . His chemistry is intriguing from this point of view .  Here was a second double life  that of a scientist who was also an artist ,  a chemist who was also an alchemist ,  a businessman who was also a magician .	None

1386	difference	0	Everyone who wants to act professionally should try to see as much drama as they possibly can  and this means in the broadest sense ,  watching television ,  cinema ,  visiting the theatre and looking at the actor 's  work carefully and analytically .  It is also important that you try and evaluate the dramatic  experience of these different forms of presentation  this is worthwhile ,  because it will make you think about the different ways in which an actor can work and the various ways in which his skills are used .  Clearly , there is a	difference	in scale and dimension between the stage , the television screen and the cinema screen , which demand changes in direction and in acting technique . One of the things you will notice when watching the television is that close - ups are used very effectively ,  and so it is of vital importance that the actor has absolute control over his/her face and expression .  You should also look at the ways in which the physical movements of the actor are organised to suit the restraints of the small screen .	None

1388	difference	2	This is not unnatural ,  as in the 1970s and early 1980s Spencer was at the Queen 's  University ,  Belfast ,  and an active member of the All Children Together Movement .  Support for this line of approach has been found in Greeley and Rossi 's   ( 1966 )  survey in the USA on the effectiveness of catholic schools .  Based on statistical data for Roman catholics educated in both Roman catholic and other schools , Greeley and Rossi noted as one of their findings that there was little	difference	in adult religious practice between the two groups . There was a group among former Roman catholic school pupils who exhibited a more intense level of practice ,  but these were also children of fervent Roman catholics .  The causal inference adopted by Greeley and Rossi was that Roman catholic schools only had a clearly identifiable and reinforcing effect on the belief and practice of this group .	None
1389	difference	0	This is something  for which surveys ,  including that of Greeley and Rossi ,  are not and cannot be intended .  Another point worth bearing in mind is the very generalizing character of Greeley and Rossi 's  studies .  There was nothing in the studies on the	differences	between individual catholic schools , either in terms of pupil experiences or the varieties of educational practice and personnel in each school . A black - box approach to the schooling process was used with no direct investigation of processes within the schools .  Finally ,  while it could be argued that Greeley and Rossi tell us something of catholic versus state schooling in the US ,  they have nothing to tell us about catholic versus Christian ,  multi - denominational schools ,  which is what most of the argument in Ireland is about .

The lotus leaf needed to line the bamboo steamer for the Szechwan dish of steamed beef and rice flour was examined with interest ,  as were the ingredients used to make the rice flour  short grain rice ,  cinnamon bark ,  star anise and special wild pepper  which were then sauted dry for 15 minutes and ground into a semolina - type texture after the removal of the bark and anise .

1401	difference	2	The fact that a wide number of manufacturers work to the same pattern means that the caterer who is topping up need not return to the same source for the top - up. Identify a selection of cutlery distributors ,  send them one of your pieces of cutlery and ask them to match it and send their sample and yours back .  There will be some	differences	, but they may be too slight to be noticed by the customers , who would normally see only one piece of each item in any case . Shopping around for a top - up will allow the best price while still keeping the cutlery service in the same style .  One way of putting off the day of replacement is to take more care of existing cutlery .	None

1407	difference	4	In times past ,  I had tried to get across to the continent as much as possible ,  but now ,  while other people were going abroad for the first time because of all the cheap travel around ,  I was  ( without intending to be anti - social )  doing exactly the opposite and taking a look around the British Isles .  All this did ,  of course ,  cost money ,  but  if you 've had even a comparatively small amount of that and then lost it ,  you do tend to realize how transient the whole thing is and not worry so much about getting it back again .  Besides , I did n't think I could now save enough to make a significant	difference	to my standard of living when I retired , so I decided I might as well enjoy it while I had the chance . In retrospect ,  I would probably have saved a little bit more ,  but there it is  I did manage to save a little bit anyway .

In these cases the student probably relies on the instructor to make the decision and knows that he is there and can save the situation if things go wrong .  It is important to make the student aware of the subtle	difference	between being safe at all times and being safe in particular conditions .

1412	difference	2	This means concentrating on the tow and only taking your eyes off the towplane for a brief moment .  Rope breaks usually occur through inattention and getting badly out of position .  They are probably almost as rare as engine failures , but there is one important	difference	. With a rope break ,  the climb out is at the normal towing speed when the rope breaks ,  whereas when engine problems occur the tow is usually slow and the climb is far worse than normal .  If the rope breaks ,  the take off field should be within easy reach for a downwind landing ,  whereas a problem with the towplane 's  engine usually means a field landing is almost inevitable .	None

1415	difference	0	the report is certainly not a definitive and unchallengeable portrait of the Metropolitan police .  In later ,  calmer moments ,  those conclusions which are not based on published research material need to be contested .  There is a world of	difference	between research findings based on safe academic principles and methodology , and those produced with graphic literary phrases , but based upon anecdotal heresay , recorded by listeners blessed with total recall . This attack was repeated again in 1987 in the Federation magazine ,  for the report had obviously hit a very raw nerve .  Its frenzied rejection was very different to that of the many projects listed in the Police Foundation or Home Office Registers of Research mentioned above ,  most of which are simply ignored and never ever receive any review .

1416	difference	4	Barrie Irving ,  the Police Foundation director has presented a paper today outlining research into the Police and Criminal Evidence Act  ( PACE )  .  Having some 1979 data on custody practices and prisoner interviews he sought to replicate the study in 1986/7 to assess the influence of the legislation on police practice .  Claiming significant	differences	in post - PACE activities he suggested these showed the need for legal measures to impact upon police practice and influence change . His observational sample of prisoner interviews ,  although small ,  had found the PACE codes of practice were followed to the letter and he argued this showed that it required the sanction of the law to effect changes in interview and interrogation techniques .  A detective inspector shrugged this off ,  arguing from practical mastery and insider 's  knowledge ,  that the practices of doing the business remained undisturbed outside of the PACE interview .

I was then asked : what 's the	difference	between a law course at polytechnic and at the university  This assumption that policemen study law becomes axiomatic .  As Smith  ( ibid .  )  indicates ,  the cost of one scholarship  ( when he was writing in 1978 )  was about 30,000 and by the late 1980s this had risen to well over 100,000 .	None
1418	difference	2	We could purchase our own houses while they lived in police colonies ,  denied the privilege of house purchase until they had fifteen years '  service ;  this classified them as peasants ,  serfs ,  living in the feudal world of tithed cottages .  After an eight - hour shift we went home  off duty  free men ,  while they in contrast went to their police houses and were available for discretional duty ,  at the call of the system twenty - four hours a day ;  proving we were independent free men and they were slaves !  All of these social	differences	were em - bodied in the symbol of uniform . Our expensive ,  good - quality tunics were well cut and belted ,  while our guard style cap ,  set up at the front to emulate the officer class ,  made us different .  Helmets and unbelted tunics were for the despised county men ,  those sheep - dippers up the road in the sticks whom we continually used to reassert our own status by looking on them as hicksville country cousins and definitely not real polises .	None
1419	difference	2	I would enter a plea that I have often made that the street officer 's  authority and discretion should be given better recognition .  It has always seemed to me rather sad that almost any move from beat duty is regarded as a promotion .  Such a plea , although laudable , has little chance of becoming reality in the present organizational set - up , for it ignores the semantic	difference	in the uniformed polis 's role and that of the 1015 per cent of the institution who form the lite in the CID . For the uniformed wollies at the bottom of the hierarchical pile ,  any move  into detective work can have parallels with a marginal movement .  It becomes a rite of separation into an area where the detective 's  need to juggle with statistics and detection rates is diametrically opposed to the constantly voiced uniform preference for action which is simply programmed to nail the prig down.	None
1420	difference	2	It is the world of ESSO men  ( Every Saturday and Sunday Off )  ,  and the real polis 's  scorn is reflected in some of the language of definition which I have outlined here .  Now ,  as a consequence of my eight marginal years on a drug  squad ,  visits to the United Nations ,  and the three years at university reading a subject which few knew anything about ,  but would be willing to dismiss along with all of the social sciences ,  I was in danger of being irrevocably cast into the mould of being a college man or academic .  I was close to being one of them and definitely not one of us because of an acquired list of significant	differences	. Given that the police are essentially an organization constrained by an ingrained respect for the pragmatism of action  regardless of the lip - service paid to the police college ,  the special course ,  or the university scholarship  it was inevitable that the hierarchy would follow the dictates of institutional philosophy and pull the marginal mover in from the periphery ;  for there is a boundary beyond which the pilgrim cannot be allowed to stray .  In all the legends or tales of the journey to individuation and knowledge ,  the liminal mover always returns to the centre and is reconstituted into structure .	None

1425	difference	0	( Professor Dudek has demonstrated that from a base of only 1.7 per cent of the population ,  the input in terms of literature and art amounts to a staggering 25 per cent .  )  Montreal is an unusual city ,  made up of 50 villages which have grown and merged together over the years to form the modern conurbation :  about 100 square kilometres in size  ( 60 square miles )  ,  encircled by the St. Lawrence River .  The various groups keep a fairly sharp	difference	between them , centering their activities , not least through the exigencies of the two languages , in their own areas : essentially in the East ( French ) and West ( English which includes the large Scottish and other cultural elements ) .

1427	difference	2	Imagine a scientist in the distant future who knows everything about the mechanism and neurology of vision ,  but who is blind from birth .  That there is something he does not know is shown by the fact that if he were to gain his sight ,  he would come to know something that he previously had not known .  This might be characterized as what it is like to see or what things look like or , most especially , what colours are like ( that is , what they look like there is no	difference	in their case ) . No amount of unsighted knowledge of neuronal activity or light wave - lengths could amount to this .  The same point can be made in a slightly different way .	None
1428	difference	0	We cannot ,  therefore ,  leave it as an irreducible fact about different physical processes that they feel different .  In fact ,  the mode of access argument is ambiguous .  It might be interpreted as saying that V has a mode of access to his own brain different from any modes of access to V 's brain available to BS ; or that V has a different mode of access to the external world , and that this constitutes the	difference	between him and BS . It is impossible to deny that V has a different mode of access to the external world from BS ,  for V can see and BS cannot .  But the question is how this constitutes a subjective difference .	None
1429	difference	2	It is impossible to deny that V has a different mode of access to the external world from BS ,  for V can see and BS cannot .  But the question is how this constitutes a subjective difference .  One can then choose to say either that it constitutes the	difference	, simpliciter . The former simply reinstates the problem of the inner feel .  Within the mode of knowledge framework ,  the feel will be explained by the special mode of access to one 's  own  brain .	None
1430	difference	2	Within the mode of knowledge framework ,  the feel will be explained by the special mode of access to one 's  own  brain .  That this will not do is what I have just argued .  The second response , that the	difference	consists solely and simply in a mode of knowledge of the external world , without invoking any internal and introspectible feel , requires one to explain perceptual experiences with different modes of access without reference to a subjective component . As far as I can see ,  the only way to do this is to adopt a behaviouristic approach to this knowledge and characterize it as an ability to discriminate visual objects .  To take this road is to resort to what I earlier described as the most primitive physicalist response to the problem ,  which involves denying that there is anything about the nature of experience that BS does not know .	None
1431	difference	2	It is the content specifically of sense - perception that must be taken non - reductively ,  if the contrast required by our concept of disposition is to be maintained .  Some philosophers might suspect that I have not considered the behaviouristic theories in their most sophisticated form .  Would it not make a	difference	if one identified experience , not with some disposition to overt behaviour , but with the behaviour of the brain as it discriminates the various sorts of stimuli within the nervous system  This is a version of the supposedly post   - behaviourist theory called functionalism ,  which treats mental states as responding to other internal and mental states as well as to external stimuli .  The first thing to notice about functionalism is that it does not fare any better than behaviourism in providing an account of what it is that V knows and BS does not ,  for BS could know all about V 's  functional or covertly behavioural states ;  so there is no lack of knowledge that his deficit could consist in .	None
1432	difference	0	Thoughts will be referred to as cognisant acts .  The simplest and most fundamental aspect of cognisance  ( fundamental philosophically and developmentally )  is what is usually referred to as self - world dualism :  the knowledge that there is a physical world out there of which I am an experiencer and that is distinct from me .  Mental development , on the constructivist view , consists in the elaboration of this knowledge ; so that if there is one central	difference	between the mental processes of the baby , the child , and of the adult it is in terms of how self - world dualism is manifest in ( and to ) the subject . The representational theory of mind treats the explanation of mental life as a kind of engineering problem ;  it starts from the inside  ,  from the representational state ,  and asks how mental states interact with one another to produce something that we would call knowledge ;  the representational theorist proceeds like a sceptical philosopher who thinks that what figures in our mental life is not reality but our mental representations of it  ( recall my saying the Fodor described his position as methodological solipsism )  .  The constructivist starting - point could not be more different ,  and might be said to be biological where the representational theory is engineering  or machinological .	None
1433	difference	0	Consider then ,  an organism in a world of inanimate objects .  ( There is a lot to be said about the role of other persons too ,  but I am leaving that out for the time being .  )  There are three crucial	differences	between the organism and the objects . ( 1 )  It can move itself and has biological needs  ( not just for food and warmth and the like ,  but the need to use its faculties  Functionlust  as it was once called by a German psychologist )  .  ( 2 )  It has input systems .	None
1434	difference	4	It means that we can think about things that are not present .  Sure enough ,  we would expect the input systems to ensure that the right kinds of distinctions are drawn  between contour changes that define occlusion and those which define disappearance ,  for example  but this surely does not mean that the possessor of these input systems is capable of thinking about unperceived entities .  What this adds up to , then , is the claim that if there existed an organism which either could not act or whose actions made no	difference	to its perceptions then not only would that organism not be cognisant , it could never become cognisant . ( It is not clear to me whether this is some kind of philosophical claim or an hypothesis .  You may say that it is refutable  and so it is empirical ;  but then  see below  our criteria for cognisance are so much bound up with what the subject can do that it is difficult to see how we could assess the cognisance of a totally passive creature .  )	None
1435	difference	0	The point of the experiments was this :  strong social pressure  was being put on these children to agree to a realist answer  ( they were not allowed out of the room until they had an answer !  )  and if their usual tendency to interpret questions phenomenally is a trivial and weak effect then this social pressure should obliterate it .  The result was that the social pressure had no effect at all .  In children between four and eight years of age there was absolutely no	difference	between the number of realist answers produced by the pairs and by the control , solo children . They knew the realist option but did not take it as a way out of a social impasse ,  because ,  I would argue ,  the phenomenalist tendency of thought is too strong .  What dominated their judgements was the salience of the illusion  that  was most up front in consciousness .	None
1436	difference	0	Where will the child now point   If he points to the empty box then it is probably fair to regard this as deliberate misinforming ,  as the implanting of a false belief in another 's  mind .  In fact we did find a clear	difference	between the three - and the four - year - olds : the younger ones typically pointed to the box with the chocolate and the older children to the empty box . But what was striking about the three - year - old 's  behaviour here was that they did this for twenty trials  .  They could see that the competitor 's  pile of chocolate growing ever higher and that they were winning nothing ,  and yet they were powerless to do anything about it !	None
1437	difference	0	Initially the subject will attend to a new stimulus but will then gradually lose interest and start to look away  ( habituation )  ;  if the stimulus is then changed in some way and if this causes a re - awakening of interest  ( dishabituation )  then we can assume that the baby has detected the change .  Another technique is preferential looking .  If the subject prefers to look at one stimulus rather than another we can assume that he has detected a	difference	between them . 8 .  This idea had a great influence upon the thinking of Schopenhauer who followed up its implications more thoroughly than did Kant .  9 .	None
1438	difference	0	The problem is that it is highly improbable that a group of patients with brain injury constitute a natural kind ,  even when they display similar symptoms on some test or other. This is because no two patients are likely to have identical injuries ,  and large groups of patients are even less likely to be homogenous .  In fact , if you probe deeper , vitally important functional	differences	between patients will emerge . In amnesia ,  as in many other  so called neuropsychological syndromes  ( developmental dyslexia ,  schizophrenia ,  Wemicke 's  aphasia etcetera )  there is probably no uniform pattern in nature waiting to reveal itself .  What you have are groups of people who display superficially similar symptoms for a variety of different reasons .	None
1439	difference	0	It is known as a speech output  system because there is evidence that a quite separate lexicon is involved in speech perception .  A pronunciation is addressed either with or without the mediation of the semantic system  our store of word meanings .  The fundamental	difference	between the two routes , then , is that a pronunciation is either built up from sublexical components ( assembled phonology ) or looked up as a whole ( addressed phonology ) . This model has been extremely successful in enabling us to understand acquired dyslexia .  Acquired dyslexia involves a loss of reading ability as a result of brain injury .	None
1440	difference	2	Moreover ,  a closer look at individual patients provides support for what was said about the heterogeneity of groups at the start of this section .  So ,  the more that surface dyslexics are studied ,  the more it becomes obvious that the condition fractionates ;  there are important differences between individual surface dyslexics .  These	differences	can also be accommodated by the dual route model . For example ,  one surface dyslexic can accurately define the irregular words that he regularizes in pronunciation tasks  ( for instance ,  pronouncing colonel as COL - OH - NELL )  .  His problem is therefore at the level of the speech output lexicon .	None
1441	difference	0	I have gone into such detail about individual patients to try to convince you first ,  that it can be misleading to categorize patients too narrowly into groups ,  and second ,  that the dual - route model I described can accommodate a wide variety of data from different individual cases .  There is an equally important additional point that I want to make .  Since brain damage can produce these very precise	differences	between patients , it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that there is one part of the brain that has the precise function of carrying out each piece of information processing that is specified within the cognitive model . It seems to me to be perverse in the extreme to attempt to resist the claim that the brain is literally carrying out these functions .  Cognitive neuropsychology thus provides powerful evidence that the level of analysis which functionalists use to describe brain processes is the correct one .	None
1442	difference	0	Although neither have been cited directly in the text ,  the philosophical ideas in this chapter have been heavily influenced by the work of Jerry Fodor and Zenon Pylyshyn .  Fodor  ( 1981 )  provides a very clear description of functionalism ,  and his book The Modularity of Mind  discusses some of the philosophical issues surrounding cognitive neuropsychology .  Pylyshyn ( 1984 ) contains an important account of the relationship between cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence , and Pylyshyn ( 1973 ) contains an interesting discussion of the	differences	between cognitive science and phenomenology . A very clear introduction to current work in cognitive neuropsychology is provided by Ellis and Young  ( 1988 )  .  Churchland 's  Matter and Consciousness  is an equally lucid introduction to the philosophy of mind .	None
1443	difference	0	The lack of explanatory force of neurophysiological and psychophysical observations is explicitly admitted by some scientists .  It has been well expressed by the biologist Richard Dawkins :  The sensation of seeing is for us very different from the sensation of hearing , but this cannot be directly due to the physical	differences	between light and sound . Both light and sound are ,  after all ,  translated by the respective sense organs into the same kind of nerve impulse .  It is impossible to tell ,  from the physical attributes of a nerve impulse ,  whether it is conveying information about light ,  about sound or about smell .	None
1444	difference	0	He asserts ,  rather cryptically ,  that It is because we internally use  our visual information and our sound information in different ways and for different purposes that the sensations of seeing and hearing are so different .  It is not directly because of the physical	differences	between light and sound This is not a very convincing escape from the circularity of the psychophysical laws .  On the contrary ,  it exposes the explanatory weakness of the Muller Doctrine ,  if it is offered as an advance in our understanding of the origin of different modalities of sensation ,  of why the world feels as it does ;  and ,  even more ,  if it is offered as an account of our being able to feel the world at all .

Soundposts are an important feature of bowed instruments but are unsuitable for plucked instruments and will deaden the sound of a dulcimer .  Try comparing a plucked note on a violin and on a mandolin and you will certainly notice the	difference	. If the posts are only intended to curve the back ,  this can be better achieved by planing a curve on to the struts before they are glued to the back .  It is possible to make dulcimers of different sizes and shapes but this does affect the sound produced .	None

1455	difference	0	One memory will certainly be of the running of far more steam trains than seemed possible in the seventies ,  not all of them successful The GWR 150 specials ,  the Blackmore Vales ,  Cambrian Coasts ,  Cumbrian Mountains and regulars for some seasons into Scarborough and over the West Highland .  While ordinary motive power generally became more standardised , and again as told later in these pages the	difference	between locomotive - hauled and multiple - unit stock less marked , the variety still remains impressive and just as many notebooks and cameras record the passage of trains at the end as at the beginning of the eighties . Liveries have of course proliferated ;  not since pre - 1923 days have so many different colour schemes been seen ,  the only snag being that often    two or more liveries are included in the same train where for example the PTE 's  dedicated stock gets diverted .

MEMORIES OF THE 1950s CHAIRMAN Sir Peter Parker was doing his best ,  but the 1980s opened with much the same worries of insecurity over government policy ,  lack of investment ,  and working practices which harked back to the old company rules .	None
1457	difference	0	Under the chairmanship of Sir Peter Parker the concept of the commercial railway and the social railway was developed at the end of the 1970s and the start of the 1980s .  The first was to be run on strictly business lines ,  while the second needed financial support .  This emphasised not only the importance of the distinct types of business but the	difference	between the businesses and the operations . So on 4 January 1982 the railway 's  commercial undertaking was divided into its separate elements .  Freight and parcels had always been seen as distinct entities ,  and these naturally formed two of the new sectors .	None
1458	difference	2	The best example of this has been the deployment of the HST fleet .  This was first bought in the 1970s by the regions ,  but it has been deployed under sectorisation with singleminded determination to maximise earnings .  Yet while InterCity is supposed to be one business , offering consistent standards throughout Britain , many regional	differences	in what the traveller actually experiences die slowly . It is now the sectors which sponsor investment in track and signalling as well as rolling stock ,  that must deal with the modernisation of stations ,  and so on .  The decisions are commercial :  what will earn the best return on the investment 	None
1459	difference	4	The extension of electrification from Bournemouth to Weymouth ,  completed in 1988 ,  saw the arrival of the new streamlined 100mph Class W2 ,  fivecar buffet units with power - operated sliding doors ,  air conditioning ,  and the return of compartments for first - class travellers .  The traditional Southernwaste not ,  want not policy was perpetuated in the reuse of traction equipment from the Class 432 4 - REPS they replaced .  InterCity 's dedicated Victoria - Gatwick Express push - pull service launched in 1984 made little	difference	to domestic services , employing ex - LMR Mark 2f coaches formed into trailer sets with a 1959 - type 2 - HAP driving trailer converted to a driving van at one end , and a Class 73 locomotive at the other. More thorough stock control completed the changed Southern scene as virtually all EMU units were renumbered to allow the first two digits to match their fleet status .  The London Midland Region ,  the only operator of wholly DC units ,  cut its varieties to just three .	None
1460	difference	1	The examples are not always abstract ballets ,  because the three aspects described above are applicable to most choreography if music and dance are to be equal partners in a ballet .   How Ashton reflects the period and quality of the music A study of five Ashton ballets shows that all are based on classical technique , despite their apparent	differences	. Each reflects something of the period and quality of the music ,  the period being of the time when written by the composer or when presented as a ballet and the quality being that inspired in the choreographer by the composer .  Symphonic Variations  ( 1947 )	None
1461	difference	0	This is something that Ashton emphasises when Natalia ,  Kolia ,  Vera and the Tutor dance to Chopin 's  Grande Polonaise  and Fantasy on Polish Airs  in A Month in the  Country  .  It is this careful attention to traditional dance rhythms which is so important to the style of both ballets ,  although neither can be called a character or national work  ( see page 28 )  .  Choreographers can make subtle	differences	between dancing to a waltz , mazurka or polonaise and there are contrasting rhythms to be found in a /34 ; time signature . Another way of accenting it is the so - called  six temps  ,  that is ,  two bars with six strong beats .  This was a favourite rhythm fur male solos used particularly by nineteenth - century balletmasters .	None
1462	difference	0	These dances mattered very much to Petipa and all nineteenthcentury balletmasters because they were expected to show off the wealth of talent found in the many imperial ,  Royal and State theatres ,  e.g. all the characters from other fairy tales who came to Aurora 's  wedding and the character dances in Swan Lake  .  Mimed dance and danced mime  However ,  the strict division of a ballet into four distinct kinds was eliminated by Fokine when he totally cut the scne d'action  from his first ballets and never replaced them .  Instead , he used what he called mimed dance or danced mime , insisting , when asked fur an explanation , that there was a subtle	difference	between them , only one of degree . To Fokine ,  Les Sylphides  was mimed dance because he had incorporated a few conventional gestures into his choreography .  Fokine said that every phrase of his dance was a gesture ,  and explained :  Undoubtedly an arabesque  has many meanings but only when it appears as an idealised gesture .	None
1463	difference	0	The scenes between Hilarion ,  Giselle ,  Albrecht and Bathilde are reminiscent of the scenes that develop Tybalt 's  hatred of Romeo from the first fight between Montague and Capulet to his discovery of Romeo with Juliet after their first meeting at the ball ,  and finally to the fight that ends in Tybalt 's  death .  These scenes heighten the tension and suggest that all will end in tragedy .  Despite the great	differences	in style between the above three ballets and despite their different libretti the three choreographers perrot ( with Saint - Georges ) , MacMillan and Ashton give valid reasons why the tragic deaths of Giselle , Romeo and Juliet , and Natalia 's lost love are the inevitable result of what has gone before . In other words ,  what happens at the beginning of the story states why the relationships between two or more characters lead to confrontations which continue onwards to a climax and finally draw the ballet to a suitable conclusion .  This last task is possibly the most difficult because the audience must be convinced that the ending chosen is the only possible outcome of everything that has gone before .	None
1464	difference	4	The cold air is made even more apparent by the swift footwork when the entire cast jump lightly upwards away from the ground .  Admittedly the dcor and lighting help to create the illusion of  changing seasons .  But if Ashton had not made these very distinctive changes in his ports de bras , the seasonal	differences	would not have been so notable . The above examples are only a few of those showing how conventional ports de  bras  can be changed .  A study of Ashton 's  ways of using them ,  or of MacMillan 's  ,  reveal how unnecessary it is to keep passing the arms through 1st position .	None
1465	difference	2	The hornpipe is not exclusive to England ,  which many seem to think ,  even though Petipa in his ballet The Daughter of Pharaoh  included a hornpipe to represent the Thames in a spectacular scene where the four greatest rivers of the world met under the sea .  Each country with a sailing history has its own version which differs only slightly from that      of others .  The	difference	lies in the rhythm of the pipe tune to which it is danced . But much more can be made out of its well - recognised movements .  A particularly fine example is that designed by de Valois for the Sailor in The Rake 's  Progress  .	None
1466	difference	0	These can roughly be classified as coming from work ,  hobbies and pastimes .  The activity involved may be heavy or light or something with a specialised technique .  For example , there is a very great deal of	difference	between sawing a large log by hand and stitching , or between playing a game of tennis and a game of cards . Embroidery requires a specialised technique ,  so does ice skating .  In deciding to use a particular occupational process in his design a choreographer has four considerations :	None
1467	difference	0	The events and circumstances surrounding such plots are difficult to control and organise because the characters are supposedly living in the real world .  So the choreographer cannot make strong contrasts between the style usually used for the other - worldly spirits and that used for the characters living in the particular setting .  He can only highlight the atmosphere supporting the plot , especially those circumstances where he has to portray	differences	between classes and thus general behaviour , idiosyncrasies , etc. , for example the contrast that must be made between the dances for all and sundry in the town square and those for the aristocrats in the ballroom of Romeo and Juliet . Nevertheless every choreographer creating this kind of romantic ballet today has to spend much time creating the proper gestures to replace the words ,  which in such ballets are never spoken but must be understood .  If the dancers perform those gestures with feeling and understanding they will express the moods ,  emotions and actions of the characters they play .	None
1468	difference	0	Natural emotional expression Because the characters of A Month in the Country ,  Enigma Variations ,  Romeo and  Juliet ,  The Invitation  and Mayerling  are supposedly living in a real world ,  the choreographers have no need to make many deliberate contrasts in the style of dance .  Certainly there is a	difference	between classes when , fur example , the Tutor dances first with Katia the servant , and then with Natalia in A Month in the Country or when townspeople dance in the street and nobles in the ballroom in Romeo and Juliet . Nevertheless much more attention has to be given to the ports de bras  of all types of character in such ballets because these supply the words not spoken in dance .  lf the ports de bras  are to be convincing ,  choreographers need to study Natural Emotional Expression .	None
1469	difference	0	They had to be more specific about the traditionally accepted forms of behaviour ,  customs ,  occupations and particular national characteristics .  It was the impact of the Polovtsian Warriors and their dances from Prince Igor   ( 1910 )  that startled Parisian and other audiences into recognition that even the most barbaric dance had a rightful place in the theatre .  The	differences	between character dance and dances of character A distinction must be made between character dance and dances of character .  It was first made by Dauberval when staging La Fille Mal Garde  .	None
1470	difference	2	In thoroughly systematised form it now applies throughout the USSR .  Much of the syllabus has become part of the training of dancers all over the world .  Its features are very much the same as those described earlier in connection with demi - caractre style ( see page 93 ) but with a very strong	difference	. The steps are always performed in boots or heeled shoes so ali the movements look stronger and often heavier .  They require accurate timing and neat footwork of the accents are to be heard and seen .	None
1471	difference	0	In some older dances they each hold a corner of a handkerchief to form a link and in some areas they link little fingers .   Italian There is little to distinguish between the Italian character dance and its demi - caractre form save only that heeled shoes are worn and thus from time to time take on a slightly Spanish flavour , the only	difference	perhaps being the more fluid way of phrasing and less rigidly accurate timing of the steps . For all their liveliness of style any of the above national dances seen in one ballet resemble those in another because choreographers such as Petipa ,  Bournonville and Saint - Lon utilised the same steps and ports de bras  again and again .  Only the music created slight differences and this not markedly because the composers used the best of commonly recognised traditional musical idioms .	None

Possibly the best of commonly recognised character dance styles are found in Copplia ,  Swan Lake   ( Old and Soviet versions )  and La Boutique Fantasque  .  Even Massine 's  choreographic genius realised that the old stylised forms were the best way to portray the national dolls sold in the shop .	None
1473	difference	3	The authors of the report ,  John Spicer and Philip Morrisey ,  say the result is that customers perceive beer prices as rising continuously ,  Beer is no longer considered good value for money .  The price freezes introduced by many regional brewers further damaged the reputation of the big brewers ,  they add .  Tesco 's , with its recent price promotion , has highlighted the price	difference	between home consumption and that in a pub , state the report . It also warns that the legislation that followed the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report in 1989 has been a flop .  There is now no more choice ,  competition or lower prices .	None
1474	difference	4	Most of it has been proved wrong .  On the face of it ,  the Friend 3 seems the model least likely to benefit from flexibility  the thick stem interferes little with the working of the cams ,  both designs have the same strength rating and there 's  only a few grams difference in weight between them .  Yet a flexible stem makes such a	difference	; horizontal placements , angled placements , pockets , all gobbled up by its voracious cams . Certainly my wire is yet to get bent and distorted with use  the real durability test of any flexible camming device .  But ,  having used a number of different twin stem units I 've found the single wire stem much more versatile ,  although sometimes a little harder to remove from stubborn placements .	None

1476	difference	0	Nature had followed art .  Danilov ,  The Voice  observed ,  had probably not even begun to contemplate his murder when Dostoevsky was shaping Raskolnikov 's  .  The two cases were laid side by side , and likenesses and	differences	were solemnly analysed as if we had here before us two real , directly comparable objects . All this brought joy to the novelist .  He often spoke to Strakhov of his pride as an author in his creative foreshadowing of facts ,  and to A. N. Maikov he enlarged :	None
1477	difference	4	For he is an eternal traveller .  As well as a rug he takes a book ,  author and title unspecified ;  the eternal traveller is also the eternal student ,  and it is as the student that Verkhovensky first appears in the manuscript drafts .  From the start , as in Crime and Punishment , Dostoevsky is projecting a theoretical murderer , the	difference	being that Raskolnikov was an ex - student , only potentially an eternal student , because in the event he got pulled back out of theory into living life . Murder brought  Raskolnikov to see that he did n't believe his reasons for committing it .  Now the other young man never believed any of his professed and contradictory reasons in the first place .	None
1478	difference	4	The epileptic makes a neat reply ,  again touching life and art simultaneously :  the author and hero of The Idiot  .  I have in mind the experience of being suddenly thrust outside time ,  which constitutes in The Idiot  and elsewhere the epileptic aura .  When this and the regeneration/resurrection theme are brought to bear upon the remark about Bazarov and the 1840s , what seemed a	difference	of degree turns out to be one of a kind . The criticism of Turgenev is only incidentally that he is stuck in the 1840s and not far - sighted enough .  New - sightedness ,  the timeless standpoint ,  hitherto unknown reality  these have an air of mystical hubris when dragged  into the open ,  but they are what Dostoevsky is really talking about .	None
1479	difference	4	As an additional benefit ,  the closed magnetic circuit of a toroidal core greatly reduces the drive requirements to produce saturation levels ,  simplifying the circuitry need by the system .  It may be felt that replacing two straight cores with a ring structure is too drastic a change to gloss over ,  but the mechanism is not too different in the two cases .  Figure 9 represents the way in which the lines of force are concentrated from the immediate vicinity and makes plausible the idea that an overwound coil would not see much	difference	in the flux changes it experiences from either system . An additional advantage of the ring core is that it will accept more than one overwound pickup coil and they have different orientations to the external magnetic field .  For example while the coil orientation shown in Fig. 10a produces the largest output ,  that 10b links none of the changing flux and has a null output .	None
1480	difference	4	Page description languages A more advanced approach to page description is to design a software language which can be used to control the processor of a display device .  It may be difficult to define a formal distinction between this and the page description formats described above , but a glance at the results makes the	difference	obvious . Compare the set of escape sequences in the previous section with Fig. 7 ,  which shows a fragment of the Postscript language .  The difference is clear .	None
1481	difference	4	It may be difficult to define a formal distinction between this and the page description formats described above ,  but a glance at the results makes the difference obvious .  Compare the set of escape sequences in the previous section with Fig. 7 ,  which shows a fragment of the Postscript language .  The	difference	is clear .

1482	difference	3	Input Z can be used as a summing input .  When used as a squarer ,  X and Y are in parallel ,  the differential inputs giving polarity information  ( negative output if either of the inputs is reversed )  .  For low inputs , a feedback attenuator compensates for the reduced output ; the	difference	- of - squares circuit in Fig. 3 , for example , used the attenuator to cancel the factor of 2 loss in gain caused by the sum term generation .

As a divider  ( Fig.5 )  ,  the Z input becomes the numerator ,  the denominator being at X. Gain is ,  again ,  adjustable by the use of an attenuator between output and Y2 ,  a technique that is used to advantage in the percentage computer in Fig. 6 ,  which gives the percentage deviation of A against B on a scale of 1 V per 1 %  .	None
1484	difference	4	In certain respects ,  what Hawkes calls the New New Criticism had what looked like connections with the older version .  Both were directed towards the formalist reading of literary texts ,  and some anglophone academics tried to minimize the strangeness of French imports by saying that la nouvelle critique  was only offering a new version of what had long been familiar in the Anglo - American academy .  This assumption ignored great	differences	in contextual forms of life and conceptual foundation . Nevertheless ,  Lodge was able to use classical structuralism and aspects of Russian Formalism to refine and extend the existing approaches of formalist criticism .  Resemblances were apparent between Northrop Frye 's  system of archetypes and structuralism ;  indeed ,  Hawkes refers ,  without qualification ,  to Frye 's  Anatomy of Criticism  as a classic of North American structuralism .	None
1485	difference	2	Hawkes ,  in turn ,  gave the book a mockingly dismissive review in the TLS  ,  without mentioning Nuttall 's  accusation against him. Nuttall ,  like Thurley ,  writes with a polemical edge ,  but both of them present their cases in a seriously philosophical fashion .  What emerges from recent counter - theory is that French - inspired theory tends to destroy straw men in its attack on reference , insisting that the relation between words and meaning is entirely arbitrary , a matter of	difference	only . The point has been frequently made that there is no necessary reason why dog should mean the familiar ,  faithful ,  barking ,  domestic quadruped ,  which in other languages ,  gets referred to as chien ,  Hund ,  cane  ,  etc. And within the language - system of English ,  the sounds and letters of d - o - g are recognizable as such simply because they are not d - i - g ,  or d - o - n ,  or l - o - g .	None
1486	difference	2	He did not intend to exclude  reality .  The error lies with Saussure 's  expositors .  Scholes , however , believes that Saussure is himself inconsistent , and responsible for later confusion , but the thrust of his argument is very close to Tallis 's , and both of them are concerned as were Thurley and Nuttall to reinstate the validity of reference and to deny that language is a system of pure	differences	, without relation to reality . Scholes provides a useful table ,  divided into three columns ,  showing how linguists and philosophers have agreed in making a tripartite division between signifier ,  signified ,  and reference ,  though they present it in a variety of terminologies .  For Frege ,  it was Expression ,  Sense ,  Reference  (  Ausdruck ,  Sinn ,  Bedeutung )   .	None
1487	difference	2	In principle it would be quite possible for the study of English poetry to begin in a similar ab initio  fashion ,  except that it would be fruitless for someone to embark on it who did not have at least some familiarity with poetry and a wish to read more .  This is because the study of poetry as  poetry  rather than as historical or cultural material  is a matter of intuitive and affective response ,  not just of willingness to accept an intellectual discipline ,  as might be the case with philosophy ,  economics ,  and so forth .  ( I grant that the	difference	is not absolute , and there may be elements of the affective and the intuitive in the pursuit of any intellectual discipline , but they are likely to be marginal . ) It could be a rewarding form of teaching to help an uninformed but well - motivated student to come to terms with poetry ,  but it would involve time and leisure .  The student would need to read as widely as possible in different kinds of poetry ,  to learn something about literary history ,  genre ,  and convention ,  and to acquire the practical - critical skills of close reading .	None
1488	difference	0	To see these activities as representing the apotheosis of Morris Zapp and the eclipse of Phillip Swallow is tempting but too simple .  British versions of Zapp are probably now in  America anyway ,  finding a proper market - based reward for their talents and energy .  American professionalism may be the ideal , but	differences	between the British and American academic systems are noticeable . The greater spread of American higher education means that ,  proportionate to population ,  there are far more universities ,  all with English departments ;  if they were as proportionately numerous in Britain ,  we would have about 1,000 universities .  Hence the wide and generally understood variations in academic calibre between American universities .	None
1489	difference	0	And ,  least definably ,  there is the cultural nationalism ,  the concept of Englishness that ,  from the beginning ,  has been a major element in the subject .  It produces a mystique which obstructs total professionalism and separates British from American attitudes .  Yet despite these	differences	, English English has gone quite a long way down the road of a more - or - less Americanized professionalism , as identified and rejected in the 1960s by Leavis , Lewis , and Gardner . From the point of view of those who are currently in charge of higher education ,  English must be an awkward subject .  It is popular ,  in demand ,  and cheap .	None
1490	difference	0	Raymond Williams came to think that a splitting of the discipline was increasingly likely ,  since cultural materialism and radical semiotics were not compatible with the dominant paradigm of literary study :  For these necessarily include the paradigm itself as a matter for analysis ,  rather than as a governing definition of the object of knowledge .  In this situation ,  the question had to be raised :  can a radically different work still be carried on under a single heading or department when there is not just diversity of approach but more serious and fundamental	differences	about the object of knowledge ( despite overlapping of the actual material of study )  For reasons which are much more pragmatic than ideological ,  I have come to think that a separation of Cultural Studies from English ,  though not easy ,  would be the least damaging way forward for both parties .  It would represent a realignment within the humanities ,  not a diminution of them .	None
1491	difference	0	Newbolt 's  attitude is still very common  not only among the British   ( especially those who have come under the influence of F. R. Leavis )  ,  but also among American free versifiers who think they are an avantgarde and who are muddled enough to think that they have Pound 's  authority to back them .  Whether they know it or not ,  they are in fact endorsing Henry Newbolt against Pound !  All the same , there is by and large a crucial	difference	here between British and American attitudes , and one that is today every bit as marked as it was in 1912 . For on nearly every American campus there is an atelier  in the shape of a Creative Writing programme ,  whereas on no British campus is there any such thing ,  and indeed the British scoff at the mere possibility  on precisely the grounds that Newbolt here puts forward .  Pound 's  exasperated bewilderment before the spectacle of British loyalty to the amateur ,  and British readiness to pay the price in tolerance of the amateurish ,  is nowhere so evident as in his lifelong esteem for Laurence Binyon ,  the editor of the Hewlett Letters  .	None
1492	difference	0	Fire has to consume to give off its light .  But light gets its knowledge  and has its intelligence and its being  by going over things without the necessity of eating the substance of things in the process of purchasing its truth .  Maybe this is the	difference	, the different base of not just these two poets , Bill and E.P. , but something more , two contrary conceptions of love . Anyway ,  in the present context ,  it serves to characterize two different personal via  :  one achieves its clarities by way of charitas  ,  the other goes about its business blind ,  achieves its clarities by way of what you might call confusio  .  And this would be the point from which to look back at Olson ,  as Catherine Seelye wants us to ,  and to regard The Maximus Poems  as embodying the way of confusio  .	None
1493	difference	0	This is what Pound could never have said .  When ,  infrequently ,  he wanted to write in some simple metre ,  he did so ;  but when more often he wanted to get away from standard metres ,  he left them behind altogether ,  no ghost of them lurking behind his arras .  The	difference	between the two poets corresponds ( not quite exactly , because the nature and history of French verse differs so greatly from English ) to the distinction that the French make between vers libre and vers libr ; between , we may say , free verse and freed verse . Eliot 's  practice ,  as his remarks just quoted make clear ,  was always freed verse :  verse freed indeed from the constraints of traditional prosody ,  yet rather constantly recalling to the reader 's  ear one of the traditional patterns it was departing from .  ( Hence ,  notably in Gerontion ,  Eliot 's  ability to approximate and even conform to Jacobean blank verse ,  yet to depart from it smoothly when he pleased .  )  Pound 's  verse on the contrary was ,  at least after Homage to Sextus Propertius  ,  free ,  not freed :  the rhythms that he sought and attained either had never appeared before in the language ,  or else had not appeared there for many centuries .	None
1494	difference	0	Thus Pound was quite ready ,  and became eager ,  to deliver a message ,  though with more obliquities and delays than the impatiently moralistic reader could see reason for ;  whereas Eliot ,  true to his inheritance from French symbolisme  ,  was sceptical and chary of conveying in poetry any message at all .  ( Pound had studied some of the same French poets ,  notably Laforgue and Rimbaud ,  but he had profited by them in a quite different way from Eliot ,  and he was averse to the central thrust of the symboliste  endeavour ,  to which indeed the imagist or imagiste  movement which he had sponsored had been intended as a challenging alternative .  )  The	difference	between the two of them showed up in The Waste , Land drafts . For among the rather few objections by Pound that Eliot paid no attention to were one or two which would have required him to make consistent ,  in terms of locality and historical period ,  some of his references to London life .  Eliot seems to have ignored these suggestions because for him the physical and social landscape of London was no more than a screen on which to project a phantasmagoria that expressed his own personal disorders and desperations  ( partly sexual ,  as one might expect ,  and as the drafts make clear )  ;  whereas Pound seems to have supposed that the subject of the poem was London in all its historical and geographical actuality ,  much as the city of Dublin was from one point of view the subject of Joyce 's  Ulysses  .	None
1495	difference	1	Pound seems to have no interest in that .  Is it not the case that George Herbert and Christina Rossetti and even Lionel Johnson are devoutly Christian poets ,  whereas Pound is militantly non - Christian   And if Pound so blithely overlooks that	difference	, does n't that mean that we have in him a critic who attends to form , to style , at the expense of what that form and that style are used so as to convey  Don't we have in him a formalist ,  in fact an aesthete   This is the brickbat that has been thrown at Pound from the first ,  and is thrown at him still ,  because of his unswerving attention to what makes poetry poetry ,  and not some other sort of discourse versified .

1496	difference	1	Ivor Stanbrook ,  MP for Orpington ,  who chairs the Conservative backbench constitutional affairs committee and is an Anglican ,  said :  The ills of society are as much the responsibility of the Church as of political parties .  The Archbishop should be thoroughly ashamed of himself at the failure of the efforts of the Church to create a better society .  Despite their	differences	, the philosophies of the two main political parties in Britain can be supported quite sincerely by Christians . Frank Field ,  Labour MP for Birkenhead and also an Anglican ,  said Dr Runcie was right to attack government polices but he should also direct his attention to the Church ,  which was self - righteousness on stilts .  Support came from one unlikely quarter ,  Peter Bottomley ,  the Northern Ireland minister .	None
1497	difference	1	Having devoted most of his political life to touring constituencies and union branches ,  he has barely needed to campaign for the constituency section of the executive over the past two months .  When Mr Prescott first backed off standing against Roy Hattersley for the deputy leadership last year ,  and then changed his mind and decided to contest it after all ,  Neil Kinnock expressed unrestrained irritation .  But the pair , openly hostile by the end of last year , will patch up their mutual	differences	. Mr Kinnock will want Mr Prescott 's  national executive support  and may sometimes even need his constructive criticism .

1501	difference	3	Being charitable ,  this could be considered ongoing profit ,  but what is to be made of Sandhurst Marketing   Tootal bought Sandhurst in 1986 for 21.7m ,  and sold it in July for a mere 4.38m .  However , rather than realising a 17m loss , Tootal 's figures show a 3.4m profit , with most of the	difference	written off earlier through the balance sheet . Sandhurst ,  which has performed dreadfully under Tootal 's  control ,  made a 2m loss up to the point when WH Smith was persuaded to buy it ,  and three out of the four ongoing Tootal businesses showed disappointing results .  The exception was clothing ,  which bucked the trend of the rest of the UK textile industry partly because it supplies Marks  Spencer ,  and partly because it makes very little in the UK .	None

Back along the waste chain ,  the Liverpool dockers who objected to the import of exactly this type of chemical should be aware that PCBs are moving about our roads all the time .  There was no	difference	between the liquid in these drums and the liquid in the cargoes they refused to touch . In Liverpool ,  a dockers '  spokesman with the Transport and General Workers Union admitted :  Drivers are n't happy handling some of these commodities ,  but at least a lorry - driver has more idea of what he is handling than a docker ,  who could have a consignment and just not know what it is .

1505	difference	1	In a statement to stock exchanges in London and Paris yesterday morning ,  Eurotunnel said :  In those circumstances ,  the banks technical adviser produced a high cost estimate for the current banking case .  We and the banks are agreed that this is not an appropriate basis for further finance .  Eurotunnel , which is already in default of its credit agreement with the banks , has in effect been given until the end of the year to settle its	differences	with the contractors to permit a viable financing strategy to be put in place . If agreement cannot be reached ,  the banks ,  which include National Westminster and Midland ,  have the power to close the project or bring in fresh management .  Last night Alastair Morton ,  the British co - chairman of Eurotunnel ,  said the banks could be driven to this by sheer exasperation through lack of progress in the talks .	None
1506	difference	1	This would involve raising an extra 1.2bn to 1.6bn .  Of this ,  25 per cent would come from a share issue in 1990 or 1991 and new bank borrowings .  However , a number of essential	differences	between Eurotunnel and Transmanche Link need to be resolved . These include agreement on curbing the cost of terminals and equipment  where the contactors '  estimate is 382m higher than that of Eurotunnel .  Mr Prescott 's  demand for the tunnel to be taken into public ownership goes beyond existing Labour Party policy .	None
1507	difference	1	This is tougher than it first looks as it does not cover news ,  sport ,  game - shows or teletext services .  Under British and West German pressure ,  however ,  ministers agreed that even this requirement should be regarded more as a political objective than a legal obligation  ( the non - respect of which would lead to prosecution in the EC Court of Justice )  .  The ministers reached their agreement despite lingering	differences	over the toughness of the text . In the event ,  Denmark and Belgium were alone in voting against .

1508	difference	1	Toxic waste monitoring row settled By RICHARD NORTH ,  Environment Correspondent THE TWO protagonists in one of the longest - running and most bitter rows about the conduct of Britain 's toxic waste disposal industry settled their	differences	yesterday . Rechem International ,  a major chemical incineration firm ,  and Torfaen Borough Council in Gwent ,  South Wales ,  agreed in an out of court settlement that a temporary injunction obtained by the company should be lifted .  Rechem also agreed to drop its request for a judicial review into Torfaen 's  monitoring of contamination supposedly caused by the firm ,  and of its publication of the results .	None
1509	difference	0	MY MOTHER smacked me .  I smack my children .  The	difference	is that she never felt guilty about it , whereas I , who have devoured baby and child books since my first pregnancy test was positive , do .

That it is a short - cut to nowhere .	None
1510	difference	0	The message behind the report is that the majority of parents has got it all wrong .  The research ,  carried out over 30 years by the joint directors of the Child Development Research Unit at Nottingham University ,  shows that two - thirds of babies are smacked before the age of one ,  that three - quarters of four - year - olds are smacked once a week or more ,  and that by the age of seven ,  22 per cent have been hit with implements .  By the age of seven ,	differences	between boys and girls have emerged , with boys being more likely to be smacked once a week than girls . The report has been published by Approach  ( the Association to Protect All Children Ltd )  ,  a new charity linked to Epoch  ( End Physical Punishment of Children )  ,  a national campaign which was launched in April .  When I read the Epoch literature I am always convinced by it .	None
1511	difference	0	It 's  absolute piffle to say that smacking children teaches them that using violence is OK. There are two kinds of violence  good or bad .  It 's the	difference	between the person who knocks you down to take your purse and the person who knocks him down to come to your rescue . Burrows believes that smacking is as necessary as kissing and cuddling ,  and finds it ironic that the same kind of arguments about parents not knowing when to stop are used to undermine our instincts in both cases .  She says :  Smacking is a way of educating the aggressive instincts of children .	None
1512	difference	4	They knew the limits .  Burrows also believes that smacking can be started at an early age .  She disagrees with Leach 's statement that two - year - olds cannot be good or naughty on purpose because they do not yet know right from wrong or understand what makes the	difference	.

1515	difference	2	Perhaps it is not possible to produce Peter Shaffer 's  1964 play about the conquest of Peru in a way that is informed by our subsequently increased awareness of how such representation works .  But in wondering it is interesting to compare a much more recent success ,  David Henry Hwang 's  M Butterfly .  Hwang 's devotion to theatrical effects suggests that he shares Shaffer 's belief that peacockery is one of the dramatist 's obligations , and both plays concern an effort at a human relationship across cultural	difference	: Pizarro 's fascination with the defeated Inca god - king Atahuallpa , and Gallimard 's desire for his Butterfly . But whereas in M Butterfly the theatrical flash and illusion is entirely implicated in the theme of the representation and misrecognition of one culture by another ,  in The Royal Hunt of the Sun ,  at least in this revival ,  it has no such purpose .  If anything ,  Tim Pigott - Smith 's  touring Compass production accentuates the way that the Inca are conceived in European terms .	None
1516	difference	1	The party 's  new policy is that workers taking sympathy action would have to demonstrate a genuine interest in any dispute .  A Labour government would have to define what that meant .  Norman Fowler , Secretary of State for Employment , is likely to exploit the	differences	already emerging yesterday between right and left - wing union leaders over how far the definition should go . Jimmy Knapp ,  left - wing leader of the National union of Railwaymen believes that his members had a genuine interest in the miners '  strike because pit closures would mean fewer coal trains .  Bill Jordan ,  right - wing leader of the Amalgamated Engineering Union ,  however argued yesterday that secondary action should be limited to direct suppliers and direct customers .	None
1517	difference	4	The trip was a good experience .  Having watched television documentaries about life in East Germany ,  Becker was keen to see for himself for the first time .  What shocked me was that one wall could make such a	difference	, he said . It was hard to believe the change you could see by moving just a couple of kilometres out of West Germany ,  one of the richest countries in the world .

1519	difference	4	Art Market :  Historical footnotes put value on clocks By GERALDINE NORMAN What apparently made all the	difference	to the price was that the clock came from a historic house , Cassiobury Park , and that it is illustrated in an important book on the craftsman Thomas Tompion , His Life and Work by R W Symonds . Collectors love to be able to show friends the book with their own clock illustrated in it .  A monthgoing longcase clock of about 1710 by Daniel Delander also profited from a good footnote ,  selling for 104,500  ( estimate 45,000 - 55,000 )  although the case which was originally ebonised is now painted blue .

1520	difference	3	There was a social stigma attached to diesel car ownership ,  too .  People thought perhaps you needed to save money  after all ,  that was the only reason for buying a diesel car ,  was n't it   What few realised was that diesels were more costly than their petrol - engine counterparts , and that the break - even point ( when the fuel savings outweighed the price	difference	) did n't occur until very large mileages had been covered . Those who sold their diesels after 50,000 miles or so might just as well have bought a petrol vehicle .  At least that was the case in Britain ,  where the gap between petrol and diesel fuel prices has always been small .	None

This is not a hardship ,  as the AX is blessed with one of the lightest and quickest gear changes around .

1523	difference	0	Generations of lobby journalists at Westminster have had to tussle with the challenge of reconciling the remarks Tory politicians are prepared to make off the record with the ringing declarations of total loyalty and conformity they deliver in public .  ( The Labour Party ,  to be fair ,  has never observed quite the same double standards when it comes to private and public speech )  .  The	difference	, and the difficulty , for the television reporter is that he inevitably becomes a partner in this process of suppression . Any television documentary is entirely dependent on what its participants are prepared to say on camera  the winks and nudges of written journalism can have very little place in it .  In that sense ,  if in no other ,  I have felt these past weeks rather like a dentist .	None
1524	difference	0	After a boom ,  inflation has gone up and there has been a disastrous showing on the balance of payments .  Maudling ,  Barber and now Lawson  the consistency of the disastrous outcome is hard to equal .  The only	difference	is that in the 1950s and the 1980s the Conservatives had more than 10 years to cure the ills of the economy while in the 1970s they had but four . The structural problems of the economy remain  inadequate saving ,  uncompetitive industry and insufficient investment in human capital .

1525	difference	1	By JOHN PIENAAR IF THIS WEEK'S striking display of Labour unity was more show than substance ,  there was no sign of it among the party 's  other ranks as they dispersed in buoyant mood from Brighton .  All around the conference centre , the message was the same from all but the largely isolated activists of the hard - left :	differences	on the detail of Neil Kinnock 's policy review took second place to its status as Labour 's only route - map to political power . Dread of failure ,  as much as positive enthusiasm for Labour 's  change of direction ,  was a driving motivation for offering the most appealing face possible at the next election .  Constituency Labour Party and trade union delegates seized eagerly on the common feeling that the Conservatives economic and political trials ,  and the disarray of the centre parties ,  were at last combining to open a window of opportunity .

Either Fairbank 's  punishment is disproportionate ,  or Whitehead got off lightly ,  Brook said .  The League appear to be saying that the	difference	between scrapping and cynical wounding is just three matches . The other club to fall foul of the disciplinary committee yesterday was St Helens ,  who travel to Wakefield tomorrow without Roy Haggerty and Stuart Evans ,  both banned for four matches .

1529	difference	0	A similar comparison was made by the Minister  ( Michael Howard MP )  when defending the poll tax in the House on 18 April 1988 .  It is entirely fallacious .

Markets like Rock Santeiro did it long ago. The huge	difference	between the official and parallel market prices makes a nightmare out of the monthly shopping budget . A modest pile of six or seven tomatoes costs about 10 or ten pence depending on your calculation ,  while a pound of meat easily wipes out a month 's  salary .

Like us , they have eight points with one game to play , but our goal	difference	is plus 10 to their four . Their final match is also in Poland .  The loss of Steve Hodge with hamstring trouble 24 hours after the withdrawal of John Barnes ,  has left England short of cover on the flanks ,  but Robson again decided against summoning a replacement .

1532	difference	1	Mr Morton described weekend press reports of a serious rift between Eurotunnel and Transmanche Link ,  the consortium of British and French construction firms building the tunnel ,  as the Batman school of journalism .  There is no row or brawl going on ,  he added .  What there is is a strong	difference	of commercial opinion . However ,  it is clear the two sides are far from agreement on the extra 382m TML claims the tunnel terminals and fixed equipment will cost ,  which Mr Morton described as manifestly absurd .

What was his game   He supported the Government , he was loyal , but there too often appeared shades of	difference	which set him apart as a challenger . He said that cabinets and parties were coalitions ;  groups of people with a common philosophy ,  providing a starting point in most discussions which enables them to work their way by dialogue through to agreement .

1535	difference	0	One must recognise that these polls take place ,  but also carefully remember that a decision about any vacancy that takes place is taken by my colleagues in the House of Commons ,  and not the general public .  Mr Heseltine also defended Nigel Lawson 's  decision to put interest rates up to 15 per cent ,  and hoped the Chancellor would be given a courteous reception when he addressed conference on Thursday .  But in his interview with The Independent , Mr Heseltine staked out the areas of	difference	between himself and his front - bench colleagues . On the NHS changes ,  he said he would support the legislation because it was designed to make the service more effective and efficient .  But he then sided with many professional and political critics of the Government 's  plans ,  saying :  Having got the legislation ,  it would be wise to proceed by demonstration of success rather than trying a root - and - branch revolutionary approach .

The	difference	is , it will be quickly pointed out , is that Hawke 's teams were winners .

Many major housebuilders are already here ,  and large development opportunities of the size of Foxley Wood are being offered .  The	difference	is that they take place within an agreed plan and programme . What is amazing ,  therefore ,  is that the agency that has the responsibility for this programme  Milton Keynes Development Corporation  has been largely wound down over the past few years and the remainder of it will cease to exist in 1992 .

Choice of a particular university or polytechnic makes even less	difference	. If you take the crude figures ,  the differences between universities look dramatic .  Over the three years ,  1986 - 8 ,  7.3 per cent of Aston 's  graduates were unemployed or in temporary employment six months after graduation ;  at Sussex ,  13.5 per cent .	None

1542	difference	4	By STEVE BALE IT IS small consolation to Cardiff that they will be spared the full force of the All Blacks on Saturday .  Yesterday 's initial tour selection is so strong as to make no	difference	. There are 10 of the players who beat Australia in August ,  all but Mike Brewer having started each of New Zealand 's  five summer Tests .  Indeed Alex Wyllie ,  their coach ,  already expects to reselect his Test team en bloc :  There wo n't be changes as long as those players keep their form .	None

1544	difference	1	By JEREMY WARNER STOCK broking analysts are about to start making choices about which of the 10 water authorities being floated in early December are worth investing in .  To ensure the successful flotation of all 10 , the Government has attempted to gloss over	differences	and has reconstructed the authorities financially to make them seem equally attractive . Stock broking firms that are involved in the issue or act for the authorities have been banned in the run up to flotation from issuing any research .

1545	difference	3	If rates fall below the exit rate ,  the customer pays the market rate plus the difference between the contract and exit rates .  Thus ,  if the contract rate were 14 per cent ,  the exit rate might be 13.65 per cent .  Should interest rates fall to 9 per cent , the customer would pay 9 per cent , plus 0.35 per cent , the	difference	between the contract and exit rates . The third element is the duration of the hedge .  An agreement would normally embrace a number of interest rate renewal periods of three ,  six ,  nine or 12 months over a total of two years .	None

1547	difference	0	A fifth mistaken approach is the facile assertion that opponents are being inconsistent .  There are two lines of rebuttal .  One is to say that there are subtle	differences	which explain alleged inconsistencies , as for example between banning experiments altogether or after 14 days yet allowing later abortions . Some people believe that the different intentions of the experimenter and the abortionist ,  or the different location of the embryo in a petri dish or in a woman 's  womb ,  are morally relevant factors .  It behoves the sceptics among us to listen and argue rather than to whoop with delight at the superficial difficulties .	None
1548	difference	0	Or it used to be so .  One of the many adverse criticisms of Albert Ferrasse and Jacques Fouroux is that ,  for involved reasons of French rugby politics ,  they have ostracised the Toulouse club together with such players as Denis Charvet and Eric Bonneval ,  who would walk on merit into any northern hemisphere XV .  Again , the Lions combination which won the series against Australia was despite	differences	in the forwards ' techniques essentially England and Scotland plus Robert Jones . He ,  however ,  is becoming increasingly petulant and argumentative ,  playing scrum - half like a thwarted 15 - year - old on the netball court .

Southgate , who took the League title on goal	difference	from Havant , will be out to avenge their penalty - stroke defeat by Hounslow in the League Cup final at Luton last April , after the teams had drawn 2 - 2 at the end of normal time . Under Sean Kerly ,  Southgate have got their act together quickly ,  even allowing for the loss of such players as Richard Dodds and Robert Clift ,  Peter Boxell and Jagdis Barber ,  and through injury ,  Rupert Welch and John Shaw .

As unusual as its styling is the XM 's  suspension system .  Instead of merely reacting to	differences	in the road surface , as a conventional suspension system does , it anticipates bumps and bends . It does this through sensors which monitor speed and body movement ,  and this information is passed on to a computer .  For normal driving conditions the computer chooses a soft suspension setting ,  but at speed and during sharp handling and emergency manoeuvres ,  it switches automatically to a firmer setting .	None
1551	difference	1	The second weakness in the Government 's  position is that in an important respect it is ambiguous .  The Prime Minister opposes entry into the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the European Monetary System ;  the Chancellor favours it .  Instead of adopting one or other of these policies , they have tried to hide their	difference	beneath an uneasy and evasive compromise . Neither Mrs Thatcher nor Mr Lawson was able to mention the subject from the platform .  This is bad politics as well as bad economics .	None

The Conservatives won 20  ( gained 6 ,  lost 9 )  ;  Labour won 29  ( gained 10 ,  lost 4 )  ;  the SLD won 17  ( gained 6 ,  lost 5 )  ;  the SDP lost both seats it previously held ;  independents won 4  ( gained 3 ,  lost 5 )  .  There is nothing new about the centre doing better in by - elections than polls , but the	difference	is now particularly marked .

The company then enters details of your property ,  and what sort of exchange  - price ,  location and so on  you are looking for ,  in its computer database .  The advantages of an exchange rather than a sale , says Mr Nunn ( who set up the business after he successfully swapped his own home ) , are : no chain of buyers and sellers to fall through , stamp duty is payable only on any	difference	in price between the two properties , and agents ' fees are less .

1554	difference	1	On the rental side ,  a three - bedroom flat in such an area will cost around 25,000 francs  ( 2,500 )  a month .  For cheaper up - and - coming areas ,  she advises buyers to look around the Bastille and Le Valois Perret ,  where prices work out at 20 - 40 a square metre  about 100,000 for a typical two - bedroom flat .  If you are going to buy in France , remember that cultural	differences	can have a big impact . The French seem more nervous about buying garden flats ,  for example ,  than the British ,  so these can often be proportionately cheaper .  Flats at the top of older buildings without lifts are also less expensive for those healthy enough to cope with walking up six floors .	None
1555	difference	4	The market is so bad now that it wo n't get any worse ,  at least in the South ,  said Richard Roberts ,  an economist with Barclays Bank .  It will go on being like it is for longer .  Many estate agents were whistling to keep up their confidence this week , claiming that people were already used to the idea of higher mortgage rates and that the latest increase would make little	difference	. But Gary Marsh ,  head of research with the Halifax ,  the UK 's  biggest building society ,  says it is inevitable that the modest improvement seen in the market over the last couple of months  especially in the South ,  where sellers have started to adjust to more realistic levels  will be damaged and the date of its recovery put back .  I think we are going to see that slight pick - up disappear .	None
1556	difference	4	In the last three years ,  for example ,  property prices have risen by 68.5 per cent ,  while the FT All Share Index has risen by only 52.1 per cent .  Add in the tax payable on share gains ,  and the comparison looks even worse .  Before you cheer up too much , though , there is an important	difference	. It is much more difficult to get at property profits than at share profits  everyone has to live somewhere .  It is also a lot easier to shop around among different shares .	None

1558	difference	0	Reserve police in the RUC wear the same uniform ,  for all that an outsider can distinguish ,  and as a consequence face the same security risks ,  but most are marginalized by the restricted range of duties they perform and the short - term status of their contract .  Part - time male reservists do only sanger  ( guard )  duty ,  either at the station or at other locations ;  female reservists are restricted in the main to the guard room inside the station ,  with only full - time reserve policemen carrying the responsibility for a broader range of tasks ,  although few are involved in the paperwork for a case file .  But the tasks of reserve police vary across sections and stations , and in some rural areas there is no	difference	in their responsibilities compared to regular policemen , knowledge of which makes part - time reserve police in Easton very sensitive to their lowly position within the police bureaucracy . Full - time reserve police on the whole are people who are disqualified from entering the regular force as a result of age ,  height ,  or physical health .  A few are trying out policing by joining the reserves first ,  although the common view amongst the reserve police is that it is harder for them to transfer to the regulars than it is for someone without experience to sign up straight away because of the greater number of reasons the police authorities are thereby given for turning them down.	None
1559	difference	0	The few females there are in senior management seem to endorse this .  A senior female officer explained to an assembly of policewomen who were being trained in how to operate a casualty bureau that they were better suited to operating the telephones because of their good manners and compassionate nature  ( FN 29/5/87 ,  p. 2 )  .  In talking to ordinary policewomen , we found many themselves adopt notions of gender	differences	in order to explain the marginalization of their duties , although others prefer this kind of work simply because it makes it easier to manage their difficult and conflicting roles as policewoman , wife , and mother . That is ,  transfers are fewer for those in administrative posts and in specialist sex abuse units ,  and the hours of work are less disruptive to home life .  Yet others rebel against this marginalization and demand both the right to perform the full range of police work  ( from which follows the wish to carry guns )  and that men should become more involved in dealing with child and female offences .

1562	difference	1	So ,  when a company first looks to expand abroad ,  the same process needs to be adopted .  Too many companies enter foreign markets without analysing sufficiently either the customers or the competition in those markets .  International marketing differs from its domestic counterpart due purely to the	differences	in the political , social , cultural and economic environment between countries . Most of this text is devoted to considering the nature of those differences and how the international marketing manager can overcome them .  How much they need to be overcome to implement a successful international marketing policy is a matter of considerable debate among marketing experts and section 5 of this chapter reviews the idea of the two main schools of thought .	None
1563	difference	0	Levitt simply asserts the opposite  that low - cost operations are the stamp of corporate cultures pervaded by the ethos of quality .  They are ,  he says ,  compatible ,  twin identities of superior practice .  There is another way of viewing Levitt 's arguments ; the relative importance of between - country and within - country	differences	to the marketing manager . By implication ,  Levitt takes the view that a global market should be viewed as one with particular market segments that may bear little or no relationship to geographical boundaries .  In other words ,  variations in market homogeneity are more marked within countries than between them .	None
1564	difference	0	Levitt considers many Japanese companies as the first truly global marketers and contrasts their practices strongly with the approach taken by Hoover in marketing automatic washing machines in Europe .  In the 1960s ,  Hoover was looking to increase the output of its manufacturing plant closer to its capacity level and so intended to boost its sales in mainland Europe .  Market research showed considerable	differences	in consumer preferences in various countries . These are summarised below .   Hoover concluded that consumer preferences must be met by providing models for national markets that incorporated the specific features market research had brought to light .	None
1565	difference	3	However ,  whilst this method of comparison relies on easily available information ,  it is not exact ;  exchange rates relate to goods which are traded internationally ,  whilst the the majority of the national product of most countries is comprised of goods which never enter the international marketplace .  The differences in real income can thus be distorted .  As just one example , agricultural goods are generally priced lower in relation to industrial products in developing countries than in industrial countries , and this may lead to an exaggeration of the apparent	differences	in per capita income . Another potentially distorting factor is that whilst average incomes can be compared between one country and another ,  they do not of themselves reveal the true comparable standard of living ,  nor the comparable potential markets for all products .  Developing countries ,  for example ,  consume many of the same goods as industrialised countries ,  but may have little or no expenditure on heating ,  public utilities ,  medicine ,  etc.	None
1566	difference	0	Some nations are predominantly tea drinkers ,  others will generally prefer coffee .  Culture influences almost every aspect of the reaction to a particular product  texture ,  colour ,  desire for innovation or respect for tradition and so on .  Although some cultural	differences	, such as meaning attributed to basic patterns of syntax in otherwise similar communication patterns are difficult to spot , a long list can be compiled of easily identified cultural seperations . More difficult to identify are the basic factors which are common to all human beings ,  but it is in these that the international marketer will be most interested ,  since they provide a basis upon which to market goods in a way which should have broad appeal .  Some cultural universals can be observed from the work of A H Maslow ,  who hypothesised a hierarchy of needs ,  whereby the satisfaction of a lower need will result in its being replaced by a higher need .

X = an independent variable ,  typically GDP per head or GNP per head of the population .  Demand for the product next year would be calculated from the formula by taking the	difference	between projected total number owned next year and total number owned currently .

1576	difference	0	It is difficult to compare the perceptions of Labour and Conservative identifiers who read the same paper since the numbers in our sample who read any one paper were low and tended to be drawn predominantly from one party or another .  A breakdown is possible only for large - circulation papers like the Sun  and the Mirror  .  Amongst Mirror readers , there was no	difference	between Labour and Conservative identifiers in their perception of the Mirror 's anti - Conservative bias , though Conservative Mirror readers were somewhat less likely to detect a pro - Labour bias . Amongst Sun  readers ,  there was little difference between Labour and Conservative identifiers in their perceptions of its anti - Labour ,  pro - Conservative bias .  Both Labour and Conservative   Sun  readers increasingly alleged pro - Conservative bias in the Sun  as the campaign drew to a close .	None
1577	difference	0	This chapter uses two techniques to investigate media influence .  To assess the impact of pervasive and consensual television news we can correlate trends in television news content and trends in overall public perceptions .  To assess the impact of more differentiated media sources we can look for	differences	between readers of highbrow or lowbrow papers , for example , or between readers of right - wing and left - wing papers . THE IMPACT OF A CHANGING TELEVISION CONSENSUS Our analysis of television news content in Chapter 4 showed that controversy reached a peak on television in the third week of the campaign .	None
1578	difference	3	But this effect had declined to only 22 per cent by the last fortnight of the campaign .  Similarly ,  readers of lowbrow papers were relatively ill - informed about polls before the campaign but caught up on highbrow readers later :  the effect of reading a highbrow paper declined from 33 per cent in the Pre - Campaign Wave to only 15 per cent in the closing stages of the campaign .  By contrast , the	difference	between those who did and did not watch BBC - TV widened : so the effect of television viewing rose from 12 per cent in the Pre - Campaign Wave to 20 per cent in the last fortnight of the campaign . Thus ,  as the election approached ,  the basis of public awareness of opinion polls shifted from more personal factors like political interest or choice of paper ,  to more impersonal mobilizing factors like television news .  The kinds of people who were most aware of public opinion polls in the closing stages of the campaign were very different from the kinds of people who were most aware of them in the mid - term  ( Table 7.6 )  .	None
1579	difference	3	We have already noted the correlation between overall trends in perceptions of opinion polls and trends in perceptions of party prospects  ( see Table 7.3 )  .  At any one time there were wide differences of opinion about party chances however .  Some of those	differences	were relatively unpredictable . It was always fairly difficult to predict differences of opinion about Conservative and Alliance chances .  In the precampaign week ,  Conservative voters were more optimistic about Conservative chances ,  Labour voters about Labour chances ,  and Alliance voters about Alliance chances ;  but the partisan influence   on perceptions of Conservative and Alliance chances was much smaller than on perceptions of Labour chances .	None
1580	difference	3	A trend analysis confirms these regression findings .  There was always an enormous difference between the economic perceptions of those who initially had Conservative and Labour preferences ,  especially those who described themselves as party supporters .  The	difference	was largest when their focus was on Britain ( not themselves ) last year ( not next year ) . Irrespective of the focus ,    however ,  the difference widened as the election approached .  Because a majority of Conservative supporters were economic optimists and a majority of Labour supporters were economic pessimists ,  the difference between net optimism amongst Conservative and Labour supporters exceeded 100 per cent :  it was 105 per cent in the Pre - Campaign Wave ,  rising to 121 per cent by the end of the campaign .

Amongst party identifiers as a whole , the	difference	between Conservative and Labour optimism rose from 93 per cent in the Pre - Campaign Wave to 108 per cent by the end of the campaign . Compared to this enormous influence of personal prejudice the influence of the media on economic perceptions was small but none the less significant .  Amongst Labour partisans in particular the influence of the media more than doubled towards the end of the campaign ,  as Labour readers of right - wing papers switched from pessimism to optimism .	None
1583	difference	3	Public awareness of opinion polls was most predictable in the Pre - Campaign Wave and became steadily less predictable as the election approached and awareness spread throughout the electorate .  Before the campaign opened the key influence on poll awareness was a generalized interest in politics ,  but as the  campaign drew to an end television viewing became more important .  Before the campaign there was a 41 per cent	difference	in awareness of polls between those with high and low levels of interest in politics ; but this declined to 22 per cent by the end of the campaign . Readers of lowbrow papers were relatively ill informed about polls before the campaign but caught up with highbrow readers later .  Conversely the difference between those who did and did not watch television widened .	None

1585	difference	0	But that is only part of the explanation for the magnitude of their swing to the Conservatives .  The fact that uncommitted voters who read the Sun  or Star  swung so much more than other uncommitted voters  suggests that these papers were particularly good at influencing their readers .  Swings were highest amongst voters who watched both BBC and ITV news , and amongst those who avoided watching highbrow television news programmes , but the	differences	between these groups of television viewers were slight . Once we distinguished between party supporters and uncommitted voters we found no consistent differences between voters with different viewing habits .   Swings were highest amongst those who relied more on television than the press for help in deciding how to vote ,  rather lower amongst those who relied more on the press ,  and lowest of all amongst the 40 per cent of the electorate who found television and the press equally useful .

1587	difference	0	On issues like unilateralism or the economy ,  papers like the Guardian  and Telegraph  did seem to influence their readers as much as the tabloids ,  but not on the question of voting choice .  Persistent Guardian  readers swung strongly towards a more unilateralist position ,  while Telegraph  and Times  readers swung in the opposite direction .  The	differences	between Mirror and Sun/Star readers were in the expected directions but quite small . Similarly ,  on swings towards optimism about the state of the economy ,  the difference between Guardian  and Telegraph/Times  readers was greater than between Mirror  and Sun/Star  readers .  Once again ,  however ,  differences between voters with different viewing habits were slight  ( Table 8.18 )  .	None
1588	difference	0	That may be true ,  but in 1987 hostile interviews with Neil Kinnock trying to explain his party 's  defence policy counted as part of the Labour Party 's  coverage .  Coverage of all  kinds can be both favourable and unfavourable  no matter whether politicians are in government or in opposition  and politicians themselves must bear the prime responsibility for ensuring that when they do get access to the media they present their own case well .  There is no	difference	between government coverage and party coverage in this respect except that government has more initiative in determining the news , which means that it has more opportunity than the opposition to ensure that its coverage is favourable . So long as balance is defined in terms of the quantity of party coverage  and not whether it is favourable or unfavourable  then the only justification for awarding the government extra coverage is that the government represents order ,  stability ,  and legitimate authority ,  which the media has a duty to support .  Those who do not approve the Mobilizing Ideal for the media should not approve extra media time for the government ,  especially near to election time .	None
1589	difference	0	Right - wing readers of a right - wing paper were more  likely than left - wing readers of that same paper to claim that their paper was biased towards the right  though a majority of both left -  and right - wing readers typically agreed that their papers were biased and agreed on the direction of that bias .  Instead of reacting against the bias in their chosen paper ,  readers tended  ( at the margin )  to defend their paper  ( if it was biased against their party )  or even to glory in its bias  ( if it was biased in favour of their party )  .  The	difference	between public responses to perceptions of bias in the press and on television was reflected in the complex relationship between voters ' allegations of bias and their ratings of the usefulness of the press and television news . Viewers who alleged bias on television tended to give television news lower  marks for usefulness than viewers who perceived no bias on television ;  but readers who alleged bias in their papers tended to give their papers higher  marks for usefulness than readers who perceived no bias in their paper  ( Chapter 6 )  .  Overall ,  although readers were well aware that their papers were relatively biased compared to television and although they rated television as much more useful for providing information about issues ,  they did not  rate television much more useful in helping them decide how to vote .	None
1590	difference	0	The switch of news focus clearly had some  influence on the public 's  agenda but a remarkably small one :  in terms of television influencing the public 's  agenda the cause seemed much greater than the effect .  ONCE IN FOUR YEARS :  THE FINDINGS A major theme that ran through our findings was the enormous	difference	between election and non - election times . In the midterm between elections interest in politics was much higher amongst highly educated voters and amongst regular readers of the quality press  the Guardian  ,  the Telegraph  ,  The Times  ,  and similar papers .  But that was no longer true at election time :  as the election approached the highly educated became less interested and the less well educated became more interested  ( Chapter 2 )  .	None
1591	difference	1	When the Constituent Assembly was dissolved after the 1917 Revolution ,  and the Bolsheviks '  Land Decree had stolen the main plank of the Socialist Revolutionaries '  platform ,  Siberian and Black - Earth peasants alike failed to give any further support to their still loyal party ,  despite the fact that for a period an SR - dominated Directory prevailed in eastern Russia .  The vote for the SRs had been strong in the Kursk and Poltava gubernii .  Further non - economic influences that cannot be ignored are ethnic and religious	differences	. These do not concern us for Kursk guberniia ,  which was almost exclusively Great Russian and Orthodox ,  but the traditional independence of the Old Believer elements in the Siberian peasantry must not be forgotten .  Kursk differed radically in this way from Poltava ,  which lay in the Ukraine .	None
1592	difference	0	A local priest was even so bold as to call the system a home - brew democracy .  In the towns they drink wine and liqueurs ,  but we ca n't do that in the villages the result is that the gents can drink ,  but it 's  forbidden to the lower classes .  Another	difference	between Nikol 'skaia and Roslavl ' was the obvious greater isolation of the former , although it was nearer to the guberniia capital . That did not mean much ,  since Kursk was itself a drowsy centre with almost no factories and only the main railway line from Moscow to enliven it .  As late as 1926 90.9 per cent of all inhabitants in the guberniia were in rural locations ,  one of the highest percentages for European Russia .	None
1593	difficulty	3	The reality of AIDS is that the person can die at any time .  The person 's  need to know when and how is sometimes overwhelming .  One of the	difficulties	is that every person 's situation is different . The medical aspects can be dementia ,  sudden blindness ,  loss of mobility ,  thrush ,  shingles ,  Kaposi 's  sarcoma  ( a type of cancer )  ,  weight loss ,  or any combination of these .  The person 's  circumstances may change rapidly ,  from owner occupier to homelessness ;  from a good income to living on sickness benefit ;  from young and active to housebound and disabled .	None
1594	difficulty	0	You cannot simply draw up a covenant  ( or a Deposited Covenant Agreement )  to cover a donation you have already made in the hope that ACET can obtain tax advantage on the sum given .  However ,  it can be possible for the documents to be signed after you have sent a payment by cheque provided that you arrange for us to hold the cheque and not pay it into the bank until we have received the signed Deed of Covenant .  What happens if I have	difficulty	in continuing to make payments  If this unlikely situation arises ,  you should discuss the problem with us .  Although ACET ,  like any charity ,  does not have the power to release you from the agreement it is likely to be sympathetic .	None
1595	difficulty	2	Emotional support The commonest cause of death now is advanced Kaposi 's  Sarcoma  a painful cancer .  Slowly growing lesions can produce	difficulties	in the lung and the gut , causing many problems including shortness of breath , and periods of continuous pain . ACET SCOTLAND :  WHO WILL CARE FOR MY CHILDREN WHEN I DIE   It is hard to fathom the pain felt at the death of a son or daughter ,  husband or wife ,  partner or friend .	None
1596	difficulty	3	Begin at the beginning ,  the King said gravely ,  and go on till you come to the end :  then stop .    Many art books follow this plan ,  especially those aiming to take in a national culture or a whole civilisation .  Art histories often make an attempt to keep to chronology , although the	difficulties	include the crucial fact that in art there is no clear sequence of events . Unlike old - fashioned narrative history ,  art has no decisive battles ,  no international treaties ,  and no changes of government .  This is perhaps a more useful analogy than might at first sight appear .	None
1597	difficulty	2	The face ,  however ,  shows a realism and subtlety of characterization that are Coysevox 's  own .  He is the first of a long line of distinguished French portrait sculptors .  Without comparative material , the reader is in serious	difficulty	about knowing whether to agree with this three - way discriminative judgement . Gombrich 's  scholarly work includes many papers on meaning and interpretation in the visual arts ,  so that the broad but thin scope of his story of art is instructive ;  by writing a survey he inevitably limited himself to a narrow range of comment .  His book stresses the history of styles ,  which he describes in sequence ,  Baroque for example being followed by Rococo ,  and Neo - classicism .	None
1598	difficulty	0	Again ,  much interest attaches to interpretation ,  as an impassive hierarchical image of the Madonna is softened through the centuries into a more human and tender figure .  The multitude of Madonnas for Italian worship in the Renaissance made this a fruitful theme for connoisseurship which has taken on the task of distinguishing authentic works from those by followers or copyists .  An art critic may have	difficulty	in deciding how far the picture needs to be considered as devotional imagery , and how far discussion can be limited to artistic merits . An extremist view expressed by a twentieth - century artist is what Matisse had to say about his responses to murals by Giotto .  When I see the Giotto frescoes at Padua I do not trouble to recognise which scene in the life of Christ I have before me ,  but I perceive instantly the sentiment which radiates from it and which is instinct in the composition in every line and  color  .	None
1599	difficulty	1	SCULPTURAL MONOGRAPHS Books about sculpture have problems all of their own .  The first and most obvious	difficulty	is that a three - dimensional object cannot fit satisfactorily on to a flat page . Different views of a sculpture can be presented ,  but you cannot move round a sculpture except with a film camera .  There is also the problem of settings .	None
1600	difficulty	2	Clearly artists working in several media have a wide range of references .  The art critic is thus bound to consider with care what standards of comparison should be used .  In the late twentieth century artists working in performance pose	difficulties	for the critic , though some observers find it refreshing rather than troublesome to consider work beyond the easel picture and the individual sculpture . In sum ,  then ,  the monograph is a major site for art critical writing ,  and ,  moreover ,  the place where the most extended criticism is likely to appear .  The reader may be disappointed by the standard of what is written ,  but unlike other sites of criticism ,  this cannot be attributed to the form of publication ,  only to the limitations of the author .	None
1601	difficulty	2	Luckily for the curious ,  this historical sideline can be followed up in a number of publications ,  both about individuals and institutions .  The authentication of works of art from other parts of the world can be problematic .  For African art , say , the	difficulties	are complicated by lack of written or other corroboration , and knowledge that extensive copying has been done . Thefts of art works are also an international problem ,  especially poignant in the case of objects with cultural and religious significance .  Occasionally auctions contain items so interesting that critics in newspapers comment on their quality ,  not just the prices they might fetch .	None
1602	difficulty	2	Divided into national schools ,  in separate publications ,  the gallery also publishes short guides ,  souvenir guides ,  books of details ,  a complete photographic record of the pictures ,  specialist publications on conservation ,  and educational material .  The keystone of the arch of publications must be the catalogue itself ,  from which the authority of other writing derives .  The catalogue of the earlier Italian schools was written by Martin Davies , and published in 1951 . the strength of the gallery 's holding of works by Giovanni Bellini made it worth the author 's while to write a preliminary note about	difficulties	of attribution : A definition of Bellini 's  oeuvre is one of the hardest problems in the history of painting .  The first difficulty is ,  despite the destructions ,  the enormous number of existing pictures ,  many of them signed ,  and in one way or another more or less Bellinesque .	None
1603	difficulty	2	For example ,  this passage in an article on Giacometti by the American critic Hilton Kramer :  shape a figure or a head from the scrutiny of the model who sat before him ,  was felt to be an impossible assault on an objective guaranteed to elude his grasp This	difficulty	was the moral center of his art , the very fulcrum of his style . To it we owe that nervous ,  spidery line of the drawings  so quick ,  so attentive ,  yet so despairing  that alerts us to the elusiveness of the subject at the same time that it perseveres in the attempt to render it .  The article ,  called Giacometti 's  moral heroism ,  is about a retrospective show of the sculptor 's  work ten years after his death ;  it does not include the name of any single work .	None
1604	difficulty	0	In person ,  incidentally ,  Diderot was an encouraging critic .  Sainte - Beuve tells us that David  always spoke of Diderot with gratitude .  It seems that David had at first great	difficulty	in making his way with the public , and was several times unsuccessful in his efforts after fame . It was at this time that Diderot ,  who often strolled into the artists '  studios ,  paid a visit to David ,  and saw a picture which the artist was just finishing .  He admired it and talked about the artist 's  meaning ,  and the noble ideas he attributed to him.	None
1605	difficulty	2	A list can even rise to evoking the mood of a picture ,  as in this description by the Goncourt brothers of Chardin 's  subjects ;  He introduces into his pictures his wash - basin ,  his mastiff puppy ,  the objects and the creatures to which he is accustomed in his home the pure simple features of the working middle class ,  happy in its tranquillity ,  its labour and its obscurity .  The genius of the painter is the genius of the home .  People in pictures can be more problematic to describe , since they may not be identifiable , a special	difficulty	with portraits . The activities of people in pictures can be equally puzzling .  Indeed ,  if the story enacted in a picture is not known ,  quite wrong inferences can be drawn from what is perceived .	None
1606	difficulty	1	In seeing African sculpture reproduced ,  the reader can remember that this art is to an extent being misrepresented by photography .  Secondly ,  the formal analysis which is second nature to a Western critic can be fruitful ,  even though it could be argued that this is a way of interpreting the objects of an unfamiliar culture rather than a description .  A further type of	difficulty	arises in descriptions of works produced in far Eastern cultures . While a Western eye is familiar with the process of looking ,  as it were ,  through an image to what it represents or means ,  an Eastern critic looks also at the surface of a painting or a drawing ,  in which a poem or other calligraphic element may form an integral part of the work .  Chinese painting and calligraphy are visual arts on much of an equal footing .	None
1607	difficulty	2	PERCEPTION How a spectator views an object is also not a simple matter ,  despite this century 's  increased knowledge of the psychology of perception .  A	difficulty	is that psychology has narrow terms of reference which can give only a few useful results , for example on the question of illusion . A classic example of exposition ,  though not uncontroversial ,  is E. H. Gombrich 's  Art of Illusion  .  This usefully explores some of the resolvable questions ,  in particular those of crucial interest to students of landscape and the human figure .	None
1608	difficulty	1	In an evaluation the critic may put personal feeling aside .  What is an aesthetic experience   The question has puzzled generations of Western historians , critics and philosophers for at least two centuries because of the	difficulty	of disentangling the aesthetic from other responses . A pragmatic view is that an aesthetic experience is what is described as such ,  and as there are varieties of religious experience ,  so there may be varieties of aesthetic experience .  Let us join an American educationalist talking to children about their understanding of art .	None
1609	difficulty	2	It was Roger Fry 's  contention that an object ,  say a bunch of carrots on a market stall ,  could be viewed in a practical way as something to eat for supper ,  or aesthetically .  This distinction can be backed up by philosophy and aesthetics ,  and descriptions can be found of the resultant moments of vision or epiphanies .  Our concern , however , is not with the	difficulties	of aesthetics , but only with what a critic writes of aesthetic experience , and how useful such an account may be . This is an aspect of description ,  while it can be suggested that other religious ,  political or social concerns are more properly matters of interpretation .  Unfortunately it is often the case that writers do not allow themselves  to be so free in autobiographical disclosures as to say exactly how they felt on seeing some work of art .	None
1610	difficulty	2	This lucid and candid prose ,  strong in the detail of a particular time and place ,  often ignores ,  and can on occasion seem to depart from ,  the sense of the literature it embodies .  The offended looks of the muzzy black citoyen  who is put in to own Salim 's  store when trade is politicised are funny ,  and important ,  and owe nothing to the Aeneid  .  But those who would prefer to explain the book as a comedy of manners , or as current affairs , might have	difficulty	in explaining the prominence given to the love affair . The plot states that an attachment to a strange woman ,  a woman who does not belong to this community of strangers ,  is succeeded by a return to the community ,  and by the dispersal ,  and survival ,  of the community .  Salim states that he was having a rough time ,  and was tired and suspicious of Yvette :  he does not say that a tribal god commanded him to leave her .	None
1611	difficulty	0	But the raconteurs of the extra - literary world are permitted to shape and turn the speech of the characters in their stories ,  and to play the pervasive evident author .  And anyone who doubts whether the method can safely be transferred to literature should consult one of Amis 's  best novels ,  Ending up  .  Raconteur and raisonneur , in his art as in his personal life , he is a concealed author who is evident enough in his hotly opinionated fiction : he is not given to expounding his own passionate opinions there , but can be recognised without	difficulty	in almost every aspect of every one of his novels , including the speech assigned to his often disputatious characters . There is a sense in which each novel of his is an opinion of his ,  coextensive with the work itself and rather hard ,  as a rule ,  to read off in summary .  These considerations affect the difficulties which attend Difficulties with girls  ,  and which come to the fore with the most Amis - sounding of its characters ,  the male lead .	None
1612	difficulty	2	The status of comedy is crucial to the debate ,  and we can at least be sure that Kingsley Amis would not object to having his practice compared with Waugh 's  ,  or to being placed with him among the monologists of the Right .  Against this monologic Amis can be set ,  by way of alter ego ,  the modernistic Amis of Barbara Everett 's  discussion of Difficulties with girls  ,  which occurred in the course of an essay on Hugh Kenner 's  fantasy of a British betrayal of Modernism ,  and which springs the surprise of conveying that Amis ,  so often supposed an enemy of Modernism ,  is really a Modernist .  She begins by recalling a remark made to her a long time ago by Larkin , about	difficulties	encountered in his private life a remark which consisted of a joke to do with the impossibility of relations between men and women , followed by the notion that women ought really to marry each other , followed by but that would be wrong , would n't it  And she notes that the same remark ,  or the same sentences ,  can be found in Amis 's  novel .  What interests her ,  apparently ,  is not the remark itself ,  but the degree to which the piece of recall  her piece of recall ,  presumably  failed to affect the novel in any way .	None
1613	difficulty	2	There are still those who prefer to take their chances in the profession without any formal training .  This used to be a lot easier to do than it is now :  for one thing ,  working in the profession means that you have to belong to the actors '  union ,  Equity .  Yet students who have completed expensive training face the same	difficulties	as an untrained actor in qualifying for an Equity card . This question is discussed later in the book ,  but it is still relevant to the potential drama student .  Becoming an actor has to be thought of in realistic terms right from the beginning and all possible problems do need to be faced .	None
1614	difficulty	3	It was the last days of the old tradition ,  I  suppose and I 'm glad I was lucky enough to be part of them .  Now there is no guarantee that a career actually exists and Equity are not making it all any easier for the new young actors to establish themselves .  And with the theatre running into	difficulties	about subsidy it 's not getting any more hopeful . A.R. In fact the dream that we all had about Great Britain acknowledging it 's  theatre and funding it properly has suffered a lot of setbacks since the sixties .	None
1615	difficulty	3	It should be noted that the largest threat to totalizing control of schools in Ireland has so far come from the integrated schooling movement .  This movement has a double constituency ,  one in the Northern ,  the other in the Southern ,  state .  Their membership , mainly middle - class , have met considerable	difficulty	in trying to achieve their limited goals integrated schooling for the children of those parents who wish it though some of the membership in the early days were aiming at a total integration of the schooling system . Until recently ,  catholics in the North were practically forbidden by their clergy to attend state schools ,  exceptions being made in certain outlying areas .  Bishop Edward Daly in Derry liberally interpreted the needs of his Roman catholic pupils from the mid - 1970s ,  allowing greater freedom and seeing to it that some alternative religious education was provided .

Dratted nuisance that Quince lad !  thought Bramble ,  and started to read the paper .  This he did with	difficulty	, partly on account of his bad eyesight , partly because of what in later years would come to be referred to as a learning disability or mild dyslexia ; and partly because he simply was n't much of a reader .

1619	difficulty	3	Traditionally ,  it was usual to take the upwind wing - tip and to hold it slightly below the horizontal .  This was because with the older gliders like the T21 or T31 ,  the wings were very high and they could not be held securely except by keeping one wing low .  However , when towing in a cross wind , the glider will tend to weathercock into wind , and the person on the upwind wing will have	difficulty	in pushing forward enough to prevent this happening . With a modern glider which has a lower wing and the wheel well ahead of the c.g .  ,  this weathercocking will be even more pronounced ,  so it is better to hold the down wind tip .  ( Just as with the cross wind take - off ,  the down wind wing should be held so that any slight pull will not help the weathercocking into wind .  )	None
1620	difficulty	0	However ,  they mean that the pilot has to be prepared for a possible launch failure or cable break on every flight .  Launch failures account for a very high proportion of gliding accidents ,  making cable break practice a very important aspect of glider training .  Most students have very little	difficulty	in learning how to make satisfactory launches . However ,  the critical few moments at the start of the launch are not always fully understood ,  and often there is an element of luck in getting it right .  Instructors can be mistaken about their students '  ability to control the initial part properly if one or two launches go well .	None

1624	difficulty	0	He commented specifically on this and his use of the Faulkner quotation by saying ,  When the writer has some urgency to speak ,  the subject matter becomes almost irrelevant .  Somehow his feelings became detached from the critical procedures  ( not that he does not handle and assess his own work critically ,  which he does )  .  He feels something ; is inspired by it ; his mind takes off ; his periods flow and afterwards he has	difficulty	in recalling their point of origination , even their exact meaning ( like Browning , see below ) . His experience is transmuted into art .  Understanding mythologies thus ,  we might paraphrase his title :  Symbols Of Life ,  which has the additional benefit of thrusting forward his debt to the surrealist poet Lorca ,  a natural child of the symbolist movement ,  whose super - realisms had infatuated Leonard from his teenage years .

1626	difficulty	0	That 's  surely putting it too high .  But there is a salience problem here .  Recall that it was three - year - olds who had	difficulty	with Flavell 's appearance - versus - reality problems ; and indeed further experiments have shown that there is a strong statistical correlation between performance on the appearance - reality and on the false belief task .

1627	difficulty	2	For example ,  one can say of a brain process that it occupies a particular point in space or that it can be displayed on an oscilloscope screen ;  whereas neither of these things could be said of ,  for example ,  the subjective sensation of the colour blue or of the thought that I hate Monday mornings .  It is difficult  to comprehend an object that is utterly unlike itself .  This , in fact insuperable ,	difficulty	is said to be overcome by proposing that mental phenomena and brain processes are the same stuff viewed within different theoretical frameworks .

1631	difficulty	1	This is perhaps inevitable since deconstruction resists teleology ,  and it is this resistance that has enabled its enemies to call it nihilist .  Leaving intellectual content aside ,  there is an obvious contrast between Norris 's  manner ,  which is in the best English academic tradition ,  clear ,  cautious ,  attentive to evidence ,  moving from one conclusion to the next ,  and Derrida 's  exuberant obfuscation .  In his introduction Norris acknowledges the	difficulty	of writing about him at all in such a context : That he should now figure as an addition to the Modern Masters series is yet another irony of Derrida 's  ascent to intellectual stardom .  No philosopher has done more to disown the idea that his writings embody some kind of masterly or authoritative wisdom .	None
1632	difficulty	0	Such divisions are not ,  so to speak ,  purely academic .  They lead to confusion on the part of students ,  and it may be too glib to say ,  as one sometimes hears ,  that such confusion and disorientation are an inherently desirable part of the educational process .  It does not always work like that , for they can lead to real	difficulties	in study , and sometimes to pastoral problems .

1633	difficulty	0	The Americans are professionals and Swallow is an amateur ,  which ,  we recall ,  has the primary sense of lover .  Yet there is one sense in which Swallow has thoroughly assimilated the professionalism of the academy .  Though he has	difficulty	in writing anything for publication , he is a scrupulous and painstaking examiner , and his own examination papers are carefully pondered , finely drafted works of art . He even dreams of publishing a concise ,  comprehensive survey of English Literature in the form of examination questions :   Collected Literary Questions  ,  by Philip Swallow .  A book to be compared to Pascal 's  Penses  or Wittgenstein 's  Philosophical Investigations  .	None
1634	difficulty	3	Yet its quasi - mystical elements prevent it from fully using its potential .  It is the heir of a nineteenth - century ideology that ,  though supposedly liberal and contemplative ,  is also litist ,  anti - vocational ,  antimarket ,  and indeed downright hostile to the idea that higher education should prepare young people to take their places in a wealth - producing economy .  An excessively elevated sense of standards means that there are	difficulties	. Academics in English are loners reluctant to engage in team projects or pull together in research centres .  They can be irritatingly slow to publish ,  and it is often difficult to know how they spend their time .	None
1635	difficulty	3	On the brighter side ,  there are those younger and more active lecturers who do their duty and generate performance - indicators in the form of books and articles .  It is true that in some cases these publications may be of extreme radical tendency ,  attacking the established  practices of academic English teaching ,  but that is no objection ,  since it is the fact of publication that counts ,  not its content .  The real problem is that the writers of such texts may make political	difficulties	within a department , or teach in ways difficult for students to understand . Again ,  English departments can be unhelpful about participating in schemes for training academics how to teach ,  claiming that teaching literature is less easily defined and methodologized than teaching engineering or economics .  At a time when a good public image is essential for universities ,  English is unable to explain itself in ways immediately intelligible to the outsider ,  is notoriously riven with doubts and disagreements that prevent it from having a shared sense of purpose ,  and may at intervals erupt into crises that attract the wrong sort of publicity .	None
1636	difficulty	0	That is because cultural literacy is a canon of information not texts .  Hirsch is trailing his coat ,  but he is concerned with what takes place in society at large ,  not in college courses .  Yet within the context of organized literary study , it is true that much of the	difficulty	students have in making sense of texts comes from a lack of information , or to use the older term , a deficiency in general knowledge . As a scholar and theorist ,  Hirsch is known ,  apart from his unfashionable but vigorously argued advocacy of intentionalism ,  for his conviction that literature is not a coherent concept ,  and has no definable essence ,  and that by extension English as a discipline has no absolute method .  He believes that literary study has a cultural and humane rather than an intellectual value ;  and the implication of his recent work is that there are other ways of attaining cultural value .	None
1637	difficulty	0	The most visible and vocal theorists have high energy and intelligence ;  they also seem to find imaginative writing rather boring before it is processed into theory .  The drift of my rhetoric might seem to be taking me towards a traditional defence of literature ,  of the imagination ,  of creativity ,  of humane values in general .  I believe profoundly in all these things , it goes without saying ; my	difficulty	lies in knowing how defensible they are in the form in which they are visibly institutionalized in the anglophone academy . My reflections are not encouraging ,  though they are not altogether negative .  The first line of defence of established literary study against culturalist pressures is to emphasize literature as literature rather than as a version of philosophy ,  history ,  sociology ,  and so forth .

1638	difficulty	1	One may choose to adopt a broadly aesthetic approach to texts ,  as is often done ,  perfectly appropriately ,  but one then encounters what seems to me a potentially disabling contradiction .  In practical pedagogy the student is encouraged to read ,  carefully ,  attentively ,  sensitively ,  a particular text .  As we have seen , there may be cultural barriers to such reading , but leaving aside that potential	difficulty	, we invite the student to make a unique , personal response to the text , to tune in to the true voice of feeling , to participate in its expressiveness ; in short , to have an aesthetic experience . This is true even of the seemingly tougher - minded Cambridge approach .  Williams has referred to a conception of literature as a series of authors to whom there must ,  must  be personal evaluative response ' or its available facsimile .	None

1641	disc	1	To do these effectively you need either an abdominal board which can be used on an incline ,  or a plank with one end raised on bricks and a piece of rope tied to that end to hook your feet underneath .  ( The angle of the incline board can be made steeper as strength and fitness increases .  )  For the sit - ups either a dumb - bell or a weight	disc	is held to the chest , and the back is kept slightly rounded with the chin on the chest . The start and finish positions are such that there is no rest until all the reps have been completed .  The sit - ups start with the back off the board ,  and end before the upper body  reaches the vertical position .	None
1642	disc	3	As a professional carver I thought it only natural to get my hands on one of those new Arbortech Woodcarvers to add to my compendium of tools last year .  I had no specific use at the time ,  but I thought it would prove a handy addition to the workshop ,  and was delighted when my grandfather elected to purchase the tool for me .  Sadly he died shortly afterwards and for many reasons it was some months before I used the	disc	. The advent of the Arbortech Carving Competition at the 1990 Woodworker Show gave me the idea of putting the tool to some good use .  My grandfather had always taken a keen interest in my work ,  and I had an equal admiration of the stories of his time spent in Burma during the Second World War .	None

1647	disc	4	Such is the waste removal power of this sort of tool ,  that safety for the operator and workpiece must be considered .  On a superficial level then ,  the SuperCut is the safer tool ,  slipping whenever problems arise ,  though there is concern about the chain breaking .  However , I found that in many instances this slipping action makes the	disc	useless , as it is unable to cut to any depth before it stops rotating . I had expected it to be best for trenching and shaping in the vertical position ,  but on all but the softest of timbers it failed to supply a substantial cut .  Conversely I discovered that it could cut with the disc flat ,  or at a slight angle ,  and I can see it having benefits for very fine work .	None

1649	disc	4	The silver cylinder and cone worked wonders ,  and I 'd be interested to try some of the other shapes .  Amongst the alternatives are tungsten ,  diamond and ruby carvers offering a range of benefits from longer life to precise detailing ,  which is vital for wildfowl carving .  There is also a drum sander , nylon brush and a steel mandrel for unmounted	discs	or defuzzing pads . All these bits are changed quite simply in the 44 with a spanner and locking pin ,  while the smaller 88 uses a C - spanner and fingers .  I found this a little fiddly ,  with the C - spanner light weight ,  but the sliding finger guard ,  which covers the collet on the 88 is excellent for ensuring digits do n't get near burrs .	None

1668	disc	2	Kissin ,  aged 18 ,  came to prominence a couple of years ago when he appeared to great acclaim at the Berlin Festival .  His recording of the First Piano Concerto is sparklingly assured  crisply articulated but with enough sensitivity to convey the inevitable bitter - sweet character of the slow movement .  This is anyway a stunning	disc	, thanks to the playing of the Moscow Virtuosi with Spivakov . Their performances of the orchestral arrangements  the Chamber Symphony  ( arranged by Rudolph Barshai from the Eighth Quartet )  and the Opus 34 Preludes  ( arranged by Victor Poltoratsky from the piano original )  are superbly polished .

1669	disc	2	Lilya Zilberstein ,  at 24 ,  is also an impressive discovery .  Her first record shows her to be as musical as she is technically accomplished .  The pithy violence of Shostakovich 's First Sonata does not come naturally to her , but she is at home in the limpid impressionism of Rachmaninov 's G major Prelude , which on its own makes this	disc	worth having .

1691	disc	3	The hot ,  hot multimedia system out there right now was developed by Robert Abel ,  the noted Hollywood middleman and go - getter extraordinaire .  Abel has put together a demonstration system called Guernica ,  which is a multimedia approach to learning about the famed Picasso painting that depicts the Nazi destruction of a peaceful Basque village by air attack during the Spanish Civil War .  Based mostly on using a laser -	disc	player controlled by a Mac II , the system allows a user to explore as the developers like to say the painting and its history . Fronted by a HyperCard - like interface  SuperCard ,  actually  the system lets users click and move from point to point on the painting and get lectures and comments from old bores ,  ex - mistresses ,  people who were there ,  dopey ex - Nazi pilots ,  Picasso mavens and all sorts of experts .  You can jump from the history of the town to a backgrounder on Spanish dance .	None
1692	disc	3	And however tasteless you may think a gift is ,  it does n't automatically make it useless .  A case in point might be the Unabashed History of Pornography from InCat Systems of Milan ,  available on well illustrated CD - ROM .  In the US , there was once a blank	disc	marketed as Invisicalc , but that now seems to have vanished . So you 're left with hardware .  Unkind critics of the Amstrad ,  er ,  Sinclair PC200 have suggested it would make the ideal present for someone with everything ,  as you would n't give it to someone who actually needed a PC .	None
1693	disc	3	Fortunately ,  however ,  there are plenty of cheaper options .  The computer catalogues are full of little hardware trinkets ,  no doubt all perfectly well intentioned and thoughtfully designed ,  but all excellent solutions in search of a problem .  And unlike software , they are not limited to one particular type of computer or	disc	format . They are equally useless on all machines .  How often have you wanted to peer into your disc drive to see what 's  inside ,  for example 	None
1694	disc	2	Until now period performances have tended to be abrasive and to whizz through the slow movements ,  making even the sublime Largo of the Double Concerto into a trivial siciliana .  Catherine Mackintosh and Elizabeth Wallfisch with Robert King and the King 's  Consort without sentimentality allow themselves a more relaxed view .  Though purists may object , the performances of all four concertos on the	disc	spring to life , fast movements as well as slow , and will equally delight those who would normally choose an account on modern instruments . Besides the Double Concerto and the two solo Concertos in E major and A minor the disc includes the delightful Concerto for Violin and Oboe reconstructed from the Double Keyboard Concerto in C minor ,  with the oboist Paul Goodwin joining Catherine Mackintosh .  It makes an ideal coupling for children of all ages to have three French masterpieces on a single disc - not just Saint - Saens '  Carnival of the Animals ,  but Bizet 's  Children 's  Games and Ravel 's  Mother Goose ,  all in fresh ,  well - sprung performances from the LSO under the ballet conductor ,  Barry Wordsworth .

1703	disc	2	Printed circuits containing 10 million transistors are already available and will fit on a penny coin .  Penzias foresees that the number will have risen to a billion by the end of the century ,  with an untold gain in computing power .  Compact -	disc	technology for encoding sound and other information has gained ground rapidly and , Penzias believes , optical fibres will soon supplant communications satellites . Open access to all this vast capacity for generation of information creates its own demands :  in the US alone 18 million filing cabinets are manufactured each year to hold the paper output .  Perhaps the most alluring prospects lie in artificial intelligence and computers that learn .	None
1704	disc	3	Digital Instruments still relies on universities and research institutes for about half of its sales .  But the Japanese have decided that anything with the slightest chance of helping to make better microchips deserves a close look .  The company has sold to most big Japanese chipmakers and many manufacturers of electronic and optical - storage	discs	. Japanese industry now accounts for nearly a third of sales .  Other firms are profiting too .	None
1705	disc	3	Such a device is called an atomic - force microscope  ( AFM )  .  Although the AFM cannot quite achieve the resolution of an STM ,  it is likely to have its uses in microelectronics .  Optical	discs	, for example , are made of insulating material ; although they can be coated with a thin metal film and put under an STM , an AFM could examine a product without destroying it . Digital Instruments will start delivering AFMs this spring ,  many to Japanese optical - disc manufacturers .  They hope to sell 100 by the end of the year .	None

1707	disc	3	Yet Tinseltown remains the undisputed home of an industry whose revenues are growing  ( in real terms )  at around 7 %  a year .  In 1990 ,  says Jeffrey Logsdon ,  an analyst at Seidler Amdec in Los Angeles ,  American box - office receipts accounted for only 2.5 billion of the industry 's  7.8 billion in domestic income ;  overseas markets added a further 6 billion .  New technology , like video	discs	, or new politics , such as the opening up of Eastern Europe , have delivered new audiences . If Hollywood is about to crumple ,  then it is its own fault .  Tinseltown is a three - tier society .	None
1708	disc	2	About two years ago Autobacs cleaned up its oily - rag image .  Car owners needing their wheel or battery changed are now greeted by men clad in bright orange uniforms and natty caps .  At each outlet there is swanky retail space , used to sell every imaginable kind of car accessory , from compact -	disc	players and car televisions to designer car seats , sporty steering wheels and even perfume to make leather seats smell sweeter . This makes sense in Japan where  ( because of stellar house prices )  most young single professionals still live at home with their parents and have cash to spend ,  and where people do not make a habit of throwing bricks through car windows and stealing things .  Consequently ,  for lack of a better alternative ,  the car has become the favoured means of personal expression ,  or as an Autobacs Seven director ,  Kenzo Kido ,  puts it ,  the equivalent of life space .	None
1709	disc	2	Mr Kido says that almost 70 %  of the company 's  customers in the Tokyo area are under the age of 29 .  This specialist market is set to boom in Japan ,  even though the market for new cars is mature .  There may be 32m cars on the road in a country of 123m people but , as yet , only 6 % of them are fitted with compact -	disc	players . Autobacs ,  which made a pre - tax profit of 7.3 billion  ( 51.7m )  on sales of 110.4 billion in the year ended March 31st ,  has the means to finance further expansion .  Shareholders '  equity of 44.6 billion represents nearly 60 %  of total assets .	None
1710	disc	2	The technology that has been substituted for human lives on the widest scale is that of the microprocessor .  Just as microchips have infiltrated the home and office ,  so they have invaded the battlefield .  The differences between today 's weapons and those of the second world war are not unlike those between a 1940s gramophone and a compact -	disc	player , armed with a laser and stuffed with chips . It does the old job much better and some new jobs too .  Although microchips give machines only a smidgen of intelligence ,  that can go a long way when sensibly applied by human masters .	None
1711	disc	4	A tower may seem round from a distance ,  but there is no need to doubt our closer observation that it is square .  Sometimes ,  moreover ,  experience can show that our reasoning is superficial and incorrect ,  as when we learn from it that ,  despite what we might think ,  an arrow fired upwards from a moving ship will not fall behind but back on to it .  At other times , however , reason can correct the appearances of sense ; from the waxing and waning of the moon , according to how it is illuminated by the sun , we can deduce that it is a globe , and not the flat	disc	it appears to be . Furthermore ,  as when we infer from observed sweat the existence of pores in the skin ,  reason can lead us from what can be perceived to what cannot .  Gassendi 's  empiricist views on the derivation of our ideas from sense - experience ,  on natural philosophy and its foundation in carefully considered observation ,  and his stress on the explanatory value of Epicurean atomism ,  were already well known to Hobbes and others when they were formally introduced into England via the publication ,  in 1654 ,  of Walter Charleton 's  Physiologia Epicuro - gassendo - Charltonia :  a Fabrick of Science Natural upon the Hypothesis of Atoms ,  Founded by Epicurus ,  Repaired by Petrus Gassendus ,  Augmented by Walter Charleton  .

1712	disc	1	Considerable skill was required in the making of corduroy ,  working - class fabric or not. Craftsmen painstakingly cut the warp ,  one rib at a time ,  with long ,  knives ;  then they brushed it to make the pile stand up. Today , of course , the process is mechanized ; four hundred razor - sharp cutting	discs	slice more than a yard of cloth in one swift pass . One advantage of corduroy ,  aside from its warmth and comfort ,  is the richness it gives colours .  The piled fibres absorb and reflect the light ,  alternating deep and pale hues and giving the cloth its unique lustre .	None
1713	disc	4	Exact Nature !  which designs and makes both plants and animals so carefully  each animal with precisely the amount and type of intelligence it needs to survive  and then squanders them so carelessly .  Life ,  not lives .  It had been a gloomy day which suddenly burst into splendour in the evening , the clouds rising behind the fields in the setting sun like mountains ( if only they had been ! ) and above , a darkening amethyst sky with the finishing touch a rose pink filigree	disc	of a moon foreshadowing the peace and perfection of a moonlit night . As she walked ,  it seemed to Jane that the stars looked down ,  calmly and mockingly ,  at this speck in the universe ,  crawling with ants fighting each other. Ants which were unimportant in the history of Earth :  Earth which itself was unimportant in the context of the universe .	None

1715	disc	1	In the first example there is a white outer skin of pure silver ,  with overlapping joins at each end .  Between this and the core is an alloy of copper and silver  ( light grey in the photo )  .  This is a solder attaching two	discs	of silver foil cupped around the copper core like the foil wrappers around a chocolate penny . The second example has no joins in the outer skin ,  only a copper - silver alloy coating ,  indicating that it was plated with molten metal rather than foils .  The mercury method ,  so popular in the Roman period for gilding ,  can also be used for silvering bronze and brass .	None
1716	disc	1	X - ray diffraction  ( XRD )  analysis  ( see glossary )  is ideally suited to this sort of problem as it requires only a minute sample and ,  most important ,  it identifies the mineral or compound present .  XRD is able to identify the metal sulphide used to make the niello and to distinguish it from the metal and from the oxide ,  chloride and carbonate corrosion products which contaminate the sample .  Thus , where element analysis by X - ray fluorescence of the inlays on two silver Anglo - Saxon	disc	brooches shows both to have a major component of silver , with some copper and sulphur . XRD analysis identifies one inlay as silver - copper - sulphide  ( AgCuS )  and the other as silver - sulphide  ( Ag 2  S )  contaminated with copper carbonate  ( CuCO 3  .  Cu ( OH )  2  )  from the corroding base silver alloy of the brooch .	None
1717	disc	3	Archaeological units are also being tempted by the impressive capabilities of geographic information systems ,  which in essence allow maps to be stored ,  displayed ,  overlaid and updated on a computer screen .  Laser light can now give us more than just music in our ears .  Compact discs can store data too , and act as a superb archiving medium for large databases , while videodiscs give instant access to thousands of high - quality photographic images on one 14 - inch	disc	. Further in the future ,  laser light looks set to replace electricity itself ,  driving computers a hundred times faster than the fastest now available .  Developments in the world of computing move close to the speed of light .	None

1719	disc	1	The 1.5 - litre injected engine with catalytic converter delivers 82bhp .  It is lively ,  flexible and responsive  a little noisy perhaps but not annoyingly so .

1722	disc	1	They 're relatively cheap ,  but need engine rpm to deliver full output and are best when handling one operation at once .  Closed - centre systems are more expensive to build ,  less sensitive to engine rpm ,  less wasteful of engine power ,  have sharper response and can cope better with simultaneous demands .  Brakes are either wet	discs	or drums . Wet brakes are always within an axle ;  dry brakes may be internal or external .  Wet brakes offer long service life through oil immersion and are n't affected by external water .	None
1723	disc	1	The first piece ,  however ,  was made at the local Syrian mint ,  at Antioch .  The study of punches Coins were made by the process of striking a blank	disc	or flan of metal between two dies ( see figs 1 and 2 ) . These dies were usually made of bronze or steel ,  and bore the design in intaglio .  In the ancient world these dies were engraved by hand ,  but from the early medieval period punches began to be hammered into the die to make up the designs .	None

1725	disc	1	When that finally came to a crisis I was within four days of complete paralysis .  I have not been kind to my back ;  I had accidents when I was a boy ,  tree - climbing and biking ,  and I have spent many years skiing .  The	disc	that slipped had done so in such a way as to be digging into my spinal chord . It had compressed two - thirds of the marrow and trapped the nerves .

1726	disc	2	But for now Kylie harnessed it to press on with the next stage of her ten year plan which had been drawn up by her musical gurus .  Stock ,  Aitken and Waterman launched a two month promotional tour of the world in London with a glittering party .  The champagne reception at which Kylie began to demonstrate for the first time a new found confidence with both press and public also gave them the perfect opportunity to milk their golden child 's latest achievement , three UK gold	discs	for Kylie the LP , and the singles I Should Be So Lucky and Got To Be Certain . From there she went on a punishing schedule of visits to the US ,  Scandinavia and Japan before returning to Australia ,  which still remains very much her home .  I suppose there might be a day when I would move away from Australia as my permanent base ,  she said .	None
1727	disc	1	The moon effect It is generally agreed that objects appear smaller and heavier as they move upwards .  The moon effect can be tested with a torchlight on a dark night and , sure enough , the light	disc	appears to get small and more intense as it rises . This effect has immediate graphic ,  sculptural and architectural applications .  Typefaces at the top of a page of a newspaper need to be larger than those lower down.	None
1728	disc	1	Mller - Thurgau is the grape variety ,  an early ripening and highly flavoured variety ,  much favoured along the Upper Rhine .  For Scheibenbuck I have not a clue ,  though it is probably the name of the vintner .  Scheibe is a wheel or	disc	and bcken is the transitive verb for to bend so I would like to think it meant wheel - buckler though I greatly doubt it .

1729	disc	1	Jury ,  audience and critics  ( including me )  were overwhelmingly pro Vengerov ,  whether he was performing Bach ,  Beethoven or Paganini .  He is not yet 20 ,  but his technical control ,  confidence ,  brilliance and intellectual depth display an outstanding maturity .  Two new	discs	bring these qualities to the fore . The orchestral one with the Israel Philharmonic and Zubin Mehta features what might be loosely called display pieces .  It needs a special artist to sustain such a programme ,  and the wonderful thing about Vengerov 's  playing is that in ,  say ,  the Paganini First Concerto ,  one can sit back and take the accomplishment for granted ,  acknowledge that he can overcome any Paganinian hurdle ,  and simply relish the way he actually makes something of the music .	None
1730	disc	2	The feeling is genuine .  And Waxman 's  Carmen Fantasy takes on a dimension of passion rarely heard in such an undisguised pot - pourri entertainment .  The recital	disc	with the pianist Alexander Markovich reveals Vengerov as a significant interpreter both of Beethoven and of Brahms . Again ,  the playing has that energy ,  that vocal quality which makes the music speak directly and movingly .  The singing lines ,  the sense of momentum ,  of progression towards and relaxation from climaxes is gauged with a natural feel for the musical contours and the poetic expressiveness of both sonatas .

Clemens Krauss was then at the peak of his powers ,  as can be heard in his versions of Richard Strauss 's  Ein Heldenleben and Don Juan with the Vienna Philharmonic .	None
1733	disc	2	The mono recording hardly shows its age and the playing is gorgeous  ( 425 9932 )  .  Krauss 's  direction of the other Strauss 's  Die Fledermaus is another irreplaceable set ,  now coming up fresh - minted  ( 425 9902 )  ,  with Julius Patzak as the most beguiling of all Eisensteins and Wilma Lipp a delightfully coquettish Rosalinde .  A bonus on this	disc	is a New Year 's Concert of Strauss waltzes in which Krauss was a master . The same series features George Szell in vital and refined accounts of Brahms 's  Third Symphony and Dvorak 's  Eighth with the Concertgebouw  ( 425 9942 )  ,  readings to lift the heart .  Klemperer 's  live account of Mahler 's  Kindertotenlieder with the same orchestra may not be in such good sound ,  but with Kathleen Ferrier as soloist this is another important document ,  and it is coupled with an unrivalled version of Brahms 's  Liebeslieder - Walzer from the 1952 Edinburgh Festival .	None
1734	disc	2	A favourite composer of Beecham 's  was Berlioz ,  so it 's  good to have back in circulation his famous 1957 performance of the Symphonie Fantastique with the French National Radio Orchestra  ( CDM7 64032 2 )  coupled with the overtures King Lear ,  made with the RPO ,  and the pre - War and still vivid Carnival Romain with the LPO ;  even if the recording of the last is a bit confined .  All show the conductor 's  empathy with the composer displayed in lyrical lines and incandescent climaxes ,  poetry and fire nicely balanced .  Completing this issue are vivid accounts of other Beecham favourites , Franck 's D minor Symphony and Lalo 's in G minor ( CDM7 63396 2 ) , both with the French National Radio Orchestra , and a	disc	of lollipops ( CDM7 63412 2 ) with the RPO . These are all stereo originals and sound as fresh as the day they were made .  EMI 's  Great Recordings of the Century features two discs of British music conducted by Beecham 's  near - contemporary ,  Sir John Barbirolli .	None
1735	disc	2	Meanwhile ,  Leonard Bernstein is being celebrated by Sony in a remastering of its huge archive of the conductor 's  recordings .  This is entitled the Royal Edition with a somewhat odd marketing ploy  paintings by Prince Charles on the front of each CD .  The	discs	are to be issued in alphabetical order of composer : the first tranche includes some Bartok , the nine Beethoven symphonies , the Brahms symphonies and works by Bernstein himself . Not to be overlooked are EMI 's  reissues of Vittorio Gui 's  Glyndebourne sets of Rossini 's  operas  Il Barbiere di Siviglia  ( CMS7 64162 2 )  ,  La Cenerentola  ( CMS7 64183 2 )  and ,  best of all ,  the late comedy ,  Le Comte Ory  ( CMS7 64180 2 )  .  To all of these Gui brought an elan that kept the high spirits bubbling delightfully .	None
1736	disc	2	The playing is truly memorable ,  the recording faithful .  It is an expensive issue ,  though ,  82 minutes of music spread over two full - price CDs .  Some rival issues add another work and others get the symphony into one	disc	. Whether one agreed with his view of a work or not ,  Bernstein was never dull .  Of so many recordings issued these days one might say ,  It 's  perfectly good ,  but was it necessary   ,  because of a lack of character and musical insight .	None
1737	disc	2	It has its pointers to the future ,  but I would have forgiven any Vienna professor in 1876 who failed to predict what was to follow .  Mahler needed to become a conductor of other men 's  music before he became a real composer .  But this is a delicious	disc	, containing not only a winning performance of Beethoven 's early Septet but the first recording of a trifle called Hymn to the Veneration of the Great Joachim . This is a waltz for two violins and double - bass composed for the violinist 's  22nd birthday in 1853 by an uncharacteristically unbuttoned 20 - year - old Brahms ,  under the pseudonym Gioseppo .  Today I suppose he 'd have written variations on Happy Birthday ,  but this is more fun .	None
1738	disc	2	More live recordings show Gunther Wand as classicist and modernist with the North German Radio Symphony Orchestra .  In Schubert 's  Great C major Symphony ,  he presents a Boult - like long view of this inexhaustible masterpiece ,  savouring the sense of adventure that must accompany any worthwhile exploration of it .  A companion RCA	disc	contains four 20th - century works , the earliest ( 1913 ) , being Webern 's Five Pieces , op 10 , polished epigrams , and the latest , Fortner 's interludes from his opera Blood Wedding ( 1957 ) , which sound much older than the Webern . Between them come Stravinsky 's  Dumbarton Oaks concerto and Frank Martin 's  Petite Symphonie Concertante ,  a work that grows in stature with every hearing ,  especially when conducted and played as well as it is here .  Yet none of these works can rival ,  for sheer novelty and strangeness ,  Sibelius 's  Sixth Symphony ,  still one of the most mystifying and mesmerising orchestral utterances of the century .	None
1739	disc	2	The disc is filled out with the tone - poems Pohjola 's  Daughter and En Saga ,  the latter  ( I always think )  just five minutes too long .  Abbado 's  latest disc as Karajan 's  Berlin successor is devoted to Brahms :  cogent and altogether admirable performances of the Fourth Symphony and Haydn Variations to join the many others of which the same could be said .  What makes this	disc	worth having is the setting for chorus and orchestra of Schiller 's Nanie , composed in memory of a friend .

At first , the playing time for both	discs	could be made in different sizes , all of which could be played on the same machine , was another advantage . In 1901 it was found that a ten - inch disc  ( playing for three minutes )  was better for most types of music ,  even popular songs ,  and the popular single was born .

1783	disc	2	Any account of these milestones has to bear both applications in mind .  It did not take long for engineers to realise they could use more than one microphone ,  and balance the music internally .  Indeed , the Illustrated London News shows that Guest Merriman 's experiment had included several microphones and a selector system , but the surviving	disc	shows no sign of active mixing . Before long ,  engineers were performing sound - mixing functions hitherto the responsibility of the conductor or musical director .  One of the earliest collaborators was the conductor Leopold Stokowski ,  who happily agreed to experiments to divide the Philadelphia Orchestra into individually miked sections for increased clarity ,  presumably in search of something more like the clarity he perceived from the conductor 's  rostrum  ( 14 )  .	None
1784	disc	2	Experiments in Paris involving transmission by telephone lines date back to 1881 ,  but it needed the technology of the 1930s to record two channels with adequate fidelity ,  synchronization and separation .  Once again ,  Stokowski and the Philadelphia Orchestra were in the forefront .  Two excerpts from Scriabin 's Poem of Fire were recorded on stereo	discs	on 12 March 1932 . These were followed on later dates by other experimental recordings .

1788	disc	2	The 1930s were also a time for experimental long - playing records .  But what one means by the first LP depends very much on your definition of LP ;  long - playing records of various types date back to the 1900s ,  as we shall see later .  The stimulus in the 1930s was , again , the cinema ; for patent reasons , some studios preferred to distribute their films with separate	disc	soundtracks , rather than have the sound printed optically on the film itself . To match a 1000ft reel of film which ran for a little over eleven minutes ,  a 78rpm turntable had to be slowed to 33 1/3rpm  ( 18 )  .  This speed was then adopted for Victor 's  first long - playing records of 193134 .	None

1791	disc	2	But before tape came along ,  the record industry came up with one more development  full frequency - range recording .  The idea of a recording system covering the full range perceived by the human ear dates back to 1925 ,  when Brunswick claimed their electrical recordings covered the range from 16Hz to 21000Hz  ( 19 )  .  However , surviving	discs	show the upper limit was more like 4000Hz , inferior to Western Electric 's 4500Hz . By 1934 the highest frequency which  could reliably be recorded had reached 8000Hz .  In 1940 the British Decca Company was asked by RAF Coastal Command if it could record frequencies up to 14000Hz ,  almost the limit of human hearing .	None
1792	disc	2	This model was first exhibited at the German Radio Exhibition in August 1934 .  It could record upon normal recording tape ,  comprising a coating of ferric oxide on a non - magnetic base .  Despite some significant developments by BBC and Marconi engineers , the system still did not give better quality than 78rpm	discs	; it only succeeded because it gave longer running - time , and it had lower running - costs because the tape could be magnetically erased and reused . It was a combination of inventions that proved to hold the secret to quality .  The two most important were iron - oxide coated plastic tape  ( first produced in Germany in 1934 )   ( 22 )  and ultrasonic alternating - current bias  ( patented by Carlson and Carpenter in the USA in 1921 )  .

Although even the best tape cassettes could not outperform the best LPs ,  they were much more rugged ,  and did not develop annoying clicks .  By 1985 sales of tape cassettes were outnumbering	disc	sales , although it had taken 40 years for the advocates of magnetic recording to see this come about . Digital Sound and the Future In less than a century the world of sound - recording had expanded from a plaything for amateurs to a world - wide billion - dollar industry ,  and it looks set to stay that way .

1797	disc	3	By 1982 ,  Sony 's  system ,  using its U - Matic videocassettes for storing 16 - bit digital audio  ( with a potential signal - to - noise ratio of some 96 decibels )  ,  had become an industry standard .  Meanwhile ,  Philips in Holland had been pioneering the use of Laservision videodiscs ,  the least unsuccessful of several types of disc for carrying video films .  These were played by a beam of laser light rather than a stylus , and Philips saw that combining digital audio with laser	disc	technology would be a great improvement upon the Dolby Cassette and the LP . The Compact Digital Disc  ( CD )  came on the market in 1982 ,  and has now practically replaced the LP as a distribution medium .  16 - bit audio has a signal - to - noise ratio which comfortably exceeds the full dynamic range of an orchestra ,  so it became possible to record orchestral music without any need to compress its dynamic range .

1798	disc	3	Of course ,  this worries the record companies ,   because the potential for piracy is great .  At the time of writing it seems that digital tape recorders sold to the public will have various anti - piracy measures built into them for this very reason .  On the other hand , error - correction pleases the record producers , because compact digital	discs	sold in the shops sound exactly like the master - tape in the studio . And archivists like it ,  because if the medium carrying the recording has a limited life ,  it is possible to copy the sound to another medium without any degradation taking place .  In practice ,  all media do have a limited life .	None
1799	disc	2	In practice ,  all media do have a limited life .  A search is now under way to find a medium with a reliably long shelf - life ,  because even if our present - day sound recordings last for a full century  ( which is doubtful )  ,  our successors will have to copy the whole collection every hundred years or so .  For analogue sound - recording , experience has shown that the metal masters used in the process of pressing	disc	copies have a very long life . But this is a very expensive way of preserving sound ,  only tolerable when hundreds of copies are likely to be sold to cover the costs .  In addition ,  the business of cutting a master is a highly skilled craft ,  and at present it is a dying art .	None
1800	disc	4	There was no impetus to develop anything more sophisticated than a spoken announcement or a separate piece of paper packed into the box .  This means that many cylinder records surviving today have highly dubious provenances ,  as we shall see later .  It is debatable whether it was the cylinder or the	disc	that was the first to have a formal label physically attached . At the 1890 Convention of Local Phonograph Companies in Chicago ,  delegates asked for a longer cylinder with a section specifically set aside for an announcement ,  but this did not come about .  The following year there was a visit to the Edison works at West Orange ,  where the delegates saw prerecorded cylinders made by an experimental moulding process .	None
1801	disc	1	The only doubt concerns the date ;  it seems these early records could be from any year between 1889 and 1891 ,  so whether Edison or Berliner was actually first to make records with a label is open to debate .  The conventional paper label was never possible on a cylinder ,  since there was insufficient flat space .  The end of the cylinder box had to suffice ( 27 ) , and paper labels were not attached to	discs	until 1901 ( 28 , left ) . It should be pointed out that they were nearly always pressed into the disc at the time of manufacture ,  not pasted on afterwards ;  so the paper and inks had to be able to withstand high temperatures .  This is one reason why metallic inks ,  such as gold or silver ,  were common .	None

Half a century later , when vinyl	discs	became the norm , there was another complication .

But the Board of Trade had a great deal of latitude to vary the precise details of the arrangement ,  and insisted that ,  for discs ,  the records should bear the stamps ,  not the sleeves .

1813	disc	2	It is not so much the label which affects the collectability of early rock records ,  but the nature of this optional centre .  Until 1957 the Decca group in Great Britain made a  detachable  piece in the shape of a triangle  ( 35 )  .  These triangle centres tend to fetch high prices among collectors , because they are pretty safe guarantees that the	disc	in question was actually manufactured during the golden years of rock n roll , and is not a more modern pressing . There is a similar consideration for products of Britain 's  other principal manufacturer ,  the EMI group .  Its earliest singles had labels printed with gold ink ;  these ,  too ,  tend to have a higher value than later equivalents printed in silver .	None
1814	disc	2	However ,  since in this situation customers never knew what they were buying ,  the scheme did n't last very long .  Alas ,  the biggest deceptions in gramophone history comprised serious music ,  which was for many years cut down ,  both in duration and instrumentation .  The first symphony to be recorded was Schubert 's Unfinished published on one twelve - inch	disc	by American Columbia in 1911 . Fortuitously ,  its very title makes the short version acceptable under the Trades Descriptions Act !  But for the next decade or more ,  nearly all orchestral and instrumental music was issued in cut - down form ,  without any warning being given .	None
1815	disc	2	A sound archivist will want a recording which gets close to the sound of the original master - tape .  The rights to Presley 's  Sun recordings were acquired by RCA Victor together with the rights to the artist ,  and although it is now known that the tapes in RCA Victor 's  vault are not actually the 1955 originals ,  they are extremely good copies ,  and all have been reissued on compact disc .  Thus collectors can get back to the sound of the original master - tape far more closely than would be possible with any 1955	disc	, let alone a forgery of one . There are very few artists whose genuine records attract prices which justify forgeries .  In 1987 the Black Album of pop singer Prince was withdrawn before it was issued ,  and only a few genuine copies escaped .	None
1816	disc	2	The Black Album ,  being a pure black sleeve  ( apart from lettering on the spine )  ,  was also particularly easy to reproduce .  There are three records which have defied the searches of record - collectors ,  and since no one alive today has examples to compare them with ,  they would seem to be prime candidates for potential forgers .  Two were scheduled for issue as Fonotipia 69000 and 69001 , single - sided	discs	nearly fourteen inches across . They comprised two operatic arias sung by the tenor Jean de Reszke ,  which are known to have been recorded in Paris on 22nd April 1905 .  It is assumed that de Reszke was dissatisfied with test - pressings ;  at any rate ,  neither was issued .	None
1817	disc	2	The above non - existent records are ,  as I say ,  obvious candidates for forgery ,  but the simple fact of their being made by obsolete technology makes it less likely that forgeries will appear .

1821	disc	2	Longer - Playing Recordings Three factors  ( size ,  speed ,  and groove - pitch )  might be manipulated to make long - playing records .  And because	discs	were on the market for a longer time , and attracted more investment , there are a correspondingly large number of freaks around . Probably the first long - playing disc records were made by the Neophone Company of London in 1904 ;  they were twenty inches in diameter .  The recordings comprised uninterrupted performances of opera overtures ,  but they cost ten shillings and sixpence each ,  and needed an outsize turntable .	None
1822	disc	2	The recordings comprised uninterrupted performances of opera overtures ,  but they cost ten shillings and sixpence each ,  and needed an outsize turntable .  So customers spent their money on twelve - inch discs instead ,  and in fact I have never seen a twenty - inch Neophone record .  The Marathon	discs	of 1912 ( 48 ) were made in the usual ten - inch and twelve - inch diameters , but with finer grooves . The idea was to record using hill - and - dale modulation ,  with the grooves packed closer together because there would be no risk of overlap .  In fact ,  the British inventor P. J. Packman took the idea a stage further ;  he developed a cutter for V - shaped grooves ,  rather than the U - shaped grooves then considered normal ,  so he got a deeper groove at the same time .	None
1823	disc	2	The new discs were also hill - and - dale ,  recorded with a relatively fine groove - pitch of 150 lines per inch ,  so a ten - inch side played rather longer than usual  ( about five minutes )  .  The grooves were U - bottomed with a radius of precisely 4.7 thousandths of an inch ,  and his reproducers were fitted with the very  first diamond styli ,  of exactly this size for minimum wear and surface - noise .  But the grooves were very shallow by normal	disc	standards , and to reduce the chances of the stylus being thrown out of the groove , the records were made absolutely flat , and a full quarter of an inch thick so they would be sure to stay that way . They turned out to be practically unbreakable as well as hard - wearing .  When I visited the Edison National Historic Site a few years ago ,  my guide told me that the full resources of his employer  ( the United States Government )  had failed to break one ;  but to find out exactly what was inside the quarter - inch slab ,  they had borrowed a diamond saw and cut one in half .	None
1824	disc	2	This proved to many people 's  satisfaction that Edison 's  re - creation was indistinguishable from the original .  Unfortunately ,  Edison was not himself a musician ,  and the technology he fathered was never used for mass - producing serious musical records .  Since 1910 he had been recording	discs	in London , and Raymond Wile 's list of Edison Disc Masters ( published in the Talking Machine Review from August 1971 onwards ) shows that many mouth - watering recordings of London opera - singers and other treasures were made . They were taken to America for mass - production .  It seems ,  however ,  that everything Edison actually issued was American home - grown corn .	None

1826	disc	1	Bigger cylinders allowed this to happen without extra wear .  But since all large commercially - made cylinders seem to have been copied from standard ones ,  there was no  increase in quality ,  only in volume .  The principle that larger cylinders will withstand more wear can also be applied to	discs	. In 1909 the Path company ,  which had by then abandoned cylinders ,  made their own twenty - inch monsters .  ( 50 )  .	None
1827	disc	2	They combined the two features of flexibility and long - playing time .  A relatively thin piece of cardboard  more like thick paper ,  really  was coated on one side with a material called Durium .  Because it was single - sided , the groove pitch was doubled to allow two numbers on each	disc	. The same company also made a French language course and many advertising mini - discs .  Despite their apparent fragility ,  there are lots of examples surviving today ,  and collectors were genuinely sorry when the series came to a halt after only forty - two weeks .	None
1828	disc	2	None of these unbreakable records succeeded in displacing shellac .  Actually ,  shellac was perhaps the least important constituent ;  the most important was slate dust ,  whose abrasive and gritty properties were needed for a rather unusual reason .  As we saw earlier ,	discs	permitted simple and cheap record - players ; but the advantage was lost if the record - players had to have sapphire or diamond points made out of precious gems . So steel needles were often used instead .  To make the needle fit the groove ,  the disc contained abrasive material ,  so the tip would be ground down during the first two or three revolutions .	None
1829	disc	2	In the late 1950s ,  for example ,  listeners had to learn how to listen to stereo .

Meyer Schapiro ,  who had a specialist concern with Romanesque art ,  was an open - minded historian of this sort .

The caption material under two	images	reads as follows : In the middle nineteenth century , before photography was in general use , Pilinski of Paris was famous ( and notorious ) for the deceptiveness of his copies of old woodcuts .

1842	image	2	A successful description of a self - portrait may not be difficult ,  but an illuminating interpretation may call on many references ,  especially other artists '  pictures of themselves .  What can be deduced from a self - portrait is often controversial ;  a critic is especially likely to read into a self - portrait some opinion held about the artist .  When , as in the cases of Rembrandt and Van Gogh , there is a whole series of pictures to choose from , books can be written on the self -	images	of one artist alone . This theme is a useful one for assessing the quality of a critic 's  writing ,  since it tempts the rash into speculation ,  while an impoverished eye will miss relevant and useful comparisons .  A theme where personal psychology is necessarily absent is the Christian subject of the Madonna and Child .	None
1843	image	1	As in books on the philosophy of art ,  or aesthetics ,  many do not in fact contain any art criticism ,  in the sense of description ,  interpretation and judgement of individual works .  Their strengths are rather in clearing the ground of preconceived ideas about the arts ,  and putting new points of view .  When works of art are described only those aspects of an	image	important to the argument are included . It is in this arena that some of the fiercest intellectual fighting about art is taking place ,  though the contests range wider than the visual arts to politics and economics .  For example ,  Chadwick states :  There can be no simple category defined as feminist art history ,  since the effect of new ideas is that much recent scholarly writing has shifted attention from the categories art and artist to broader issues concerning ideologies of gender ,  sexuality ,  and power .	None
1844	image	1	A further example of abstract form which is not mere pattern is Tantric art .  A Tantric painting or drawing has a spiritual purpose ,  to assist the user in meditation .  As a sound is a mantra , so an	image	is a yantra , the two used together making a powerful combination for spiritual exercises . A description of a Tantric painting as a linear diagram may seem uninteresting ,  but then the effect of such a picture is not meant to be pleasure for the eye alone ,  but for religious use .  WAYS OF DESCRIBING	None
1845	image	1	There are other ways of description ,  which may incidentally be employed by a critic ,  or can be useful to a reader as a check on the validity of a verbal description .  In chapter 4 ,  on monographs ,  there were some comments on the photography of art as a complement to criticism ;  there are some other issues about how accurate or misleading photographs can be .  Perhaps this is the more important in the late twentieth century now that this means of	image	- making is so familiar that some people actually imagine that a photograph shows the world as it is . In truth ,  the camera is a ruthless editor of visual information ;  this can be made plain by looking at a picture ,  say of the eighteenth century ,  and comparing it with a contemporary print ,  perhaps an aquatint ,  and a modern photograph .  The images carry different information .	None
1846	image	1	After all ,  it is an original work in itself .  Nevertheless ,  the differences between painting and print may be instructive ,  and help the interpretation of both .  By other forms of reproduction an	image	may be more or less degraded , so that nothing can be learnt from them . There remains the courtesy paid by one art to another ,  as in the poem which Baudelaire suggested might be a high form of critical writing .  Or it may be music ,  as in Mussorgsky 's  composition which he entitled Pictures from an Exhibition .	None
1847	image	2	The testimonies in the book were obtained mostly from the underlings of the house ,  led by sly ,  supportive Bert ,  a man who was able to take and to give pleasure  a fine portrait ,  which is also a self - portrait ,  of a second father .  Bert 's  testimony ,  and Ilse 's  ,  are probably paramount .  The	image	she gives of himself as a boy , is one of dependency , extreme docility . It was my natural character ,  you think ,  evident from birth .  Ilse had been trained in an orphanage ,  and he then tells her ,  with a smile :  I would n't claim any privilege that an orphan was n't entitled to .	None
1848	image	2	Take ,  for example ,  the Jewish question as it arises in the novel .  Patrick has been hired by an obnoxiously trendy mismated publisher .  He labours scornfully for this Simon Giles , faintly comforted by a corner in Classical studies which has been granted him for reasons to do with the firm 's	image	. Between Patrick and Mrs Giles there flows ,  or gutters ,  a current of dreary sexual electricity .  He fancies that Simon is Jewish ,  and that he gives off a slight hot smell .	None
1849	image	2	Levi was an author who ,  without detriment to the other people who figure in his books ,  wrote all the time about himself ,  both in autobiographical and in fictional form .  The modes which he adopted were such as to  license  elisions and lacunae ,  to enable him to leave out bits of his life  a procedure  which would seem to be connected with his scepticism about what can be known about people by biographers .  In Moments of Reprieve he remarks : What the true	image	of each of us may be in the end is a meaningless question . In The Periodic Table  he mentions a woman dear to my heart who was murdered at Auschwitz :  but the book on Auschwitz does not discuss his relationship with her .  In The Wrench  he creates the rigger Faussone ,  the practical man whose cranes girdle the world and who keeps returning ,  a little heavy - footed ,  to the house in Turin where two old aunts fuss over his welfare :  Faussone was spoken of as my alter ego ,  and the book has to struggle to accommodate him as a second person ,  available for interview by Levi .	None
1850	image	3	Action ,  power ,  are thought to be contrasted ,  in Babel 's  stories ,  with learning ,  devotion ,  resignation ,  suffering  those Jewish things .  His ambivalence is a bespectacled look at the long legs of the divisional commander ,  which were like girls sheathed to the neck in shining riding - boots .  The	image	summoned by a narrator whose exhausted dreams are filled with girls is like nothing we would ever meet in the literal Levi . But the literal Levi is a writer who has his own way of interesting himself in the contrasts which have been attributed to Babel .  Levi was interested in action ,  purpose ,  work ,  and capable of them :  and the capacity may have been formed in contention with a desire to withdraw and perhaps to give up.	None
1851	image	3	Kelman makes Doyle charming ,  and it is impossible to read the book without gaining the sense of a fully - developed authorial fellow - feeling .  Not that Doyle is n't taxing and maddening too .  His consciousness delivers paranoid	images	of aggression and hostility . He is against racism and sexism ,  but is capable of reflecting :  He was in love with Alison Houston .  And he wanted to grab a hold of her .	None

1854	image	2	And it  has to be said ,  he wrote ,  that its opposite ,  a feeling of elation ,  equally physical ,  equally extra - physical ,  has also been a constant feature of my life ,  manifesting itself regularly though impossible to predict ,  a reeling in the chest this time ,  the chest and perhaps the throat ,  a feeling of the heart leaping and the blood pumping ,  it came when I first took up a brush and made a mark on paper ,  it came when I picked up the first readymade and felt it transformed by that very action ,  it came when Madge rang to say she could not go on ,  when Annie wrote to say she was not coming back ,  when the idea of the glass first popped into my head .  So ,  wrote Harsnet ,  there is continuity as well as discontinuity ,  but that does not mean ,  he wrote ,  that there exists what is called character ,  personality ,  character  ,  Goldberg wrote in the margin ,  personality  ,  as they seem to think ,  wrote Harsnet  ( and Goldberg went on typing )  ,  when they say you have such a generous character if you would only recognize it ,  or you have so much to offer ,  or it is not for myself I speak but for you ,  not for myself I mourn but for the waste of all that generosity ,  when they pour those words over you ,  character ,  generosity ,  warmth ,  looking sad ,  shedding tears ,  putting on a brave face ,  saying do n't pay any attention to me ,  or ,  it 's  nothing ,  forget it ,  I 'm crying for the waste ,  meaning waste if it 's  not directed towards them ,  but you have only to see what happens when one lets oneself be persuaded by that sort of thing ,  wrote Harsnet ,  you have only to see what happened to Hutchinson ,  MacMahon ,  Rollins and Goldberg .  Taken in by the	image	of yourself they present you with , wrote Harsnet , instead of waiting in patience for the beginning , instead of waiting and then beginning , though beginning , having begun , he wrote , is not everything , is far from everything . It is quite possible ,  he wrote ,  that it will lead nowhere ,  even when one has begun at the right time in the right spirit ,  or at least not at the wrong time ,  in the wrong spirit ,  with the wrong plans and having made the wrong preparations ,  with the wrong tools and the wrong principles ,  on the wrong surface and with the wrong conception .  Though it may well be ,  he wrote ,  that one actually achieves  more working with the wrong plans and in the wrong spirit ,  with the wrong tools and the wrong principles ,  on the wrong surface and with the wrong conception ,  it may well be ,  he wrote  ( and Goldberg typed )  ,  that one achieves more than working with the right plans and in the right spirit ,  with the right tools and the right principles ,  on the right surface and with the right conception ,  though right and wrong and more and less are relative concepts and what seems right at one moment to one person may seem wrong at the same moment to another Person or at another moment to the same person ,  and what seems more to one person at one moment may seem less to another person at the same moment or at another moment to the same person ,  right ,  wrong ,  more ,  less ,  relative concepts  ,  scribbled Goldberg ,  in the margin ,  panting slightly as he bent over his old Olivetti Portable ,  there is only the beginning ,  wrote Harsnet ,  or rather ,  there is only having begun ,  beginning  ,  scribbled Goldberg ,  aware now of the black stains on his hands left by the felt - tip pen ,  having begun  ,  there is only the feeling in the pit of the stomach or the feeling in the chest ,  wrote Harsnet ,  the feeling of sickness or the feeling of elation ,  those are not relative ,  he wrote ,  those are absolute .

Here too , Ghatak made use of Jung in his thinking about popular culture , looking for ways of using psychoanalytic concepts , unconscious motifs and	images	, in order to affect the audience at a deeper , less conscious level than most committed film . At the same time ,  Ghatak believed in experiment ,  in the need for an experimental cinema .  He was interested in the work of Norman MacLaren ,  the Surrealists ,  Godard .	None
1865	image	2	In extreme cases anthropologists have found such a role impossible to live with ,  for the field situation was beyond their previous imaginations .  Castenada  ( 1970 )  ,  for example ,  found he was dealing with new events and totally new ways of understanding .  As a result , he necessarily developed a new self -	image	, and took on a new social personality in the process . In Castenada 's  case ,  he enters a world so different that he comes to accept reality itself as nothing but a social construct ,  with effects so devastating that ethnography becomes mysticism  ( Goward 1984 :  90 )  .  For Jeanne Favret - Saada  ( 1980 )  ,  who set out to study witchcraft in the French Bocage ,  the only means of moving in on the discourse she hoped to understand was to become part of it .	None
1866	image	2	Just as the white - coated doctors in hospitals symbolize the clean and purifying nature of the healer ,  so the dark uniform of the police symbolizes not just the force identity ,  but also the presence of the avenger ,  who purifies through retribution rather than by cure .  It is the marker of force and hence continues to sustain the continuing paradox of police force  police service which remains unresolved ,  on which I will say more later in relation to the role of women police officers .  The dark uniform we wore had a military cap with polished brim , and in our fashioned tunics of soft serge and shiny boots we presented an avenging	image	, clothed in the symbolic colour of death and darkness . Black is a light absorbent ,  non - reflective colour and most suitable for controllers who operate with a degree of social anonymity ,  upholding the rule of law and the abstractions of the legal system .  In such a world ,  individuality is never a prized characteristic ,  and an attempt in the early 1980s to remove the one remaining individualizing feature  the shoulder numeral or collar number  was correctly rejected by civilians as a structural move towards an even greater anonymity .	None
1867	image	2	In such a world ,  individuality is never a prized characteristic ,  and an attempt in the early 1980s to remove the one remaining individualizing feature  the shoulder numeral or collar number  was correctly rejected by civilians as a structural move towards an even greater anonymity .  As Reiner  ( 1980 )  suggested ,  the riot gear in which the police are increasingly seen ,  with shields ,  visored helmets ,  knee - length boots ,  and flame - proof overalls ,  enhances their avenging appearance .  I suspect it is no accident the politics of the times seems to parallel the growing toughness of the police	image	, or that the police have taken on an increasing resemblance to the black - clothed enemies of goodness who sprinkle the popular science fantasy films such as Star Wars , Superman , and the like . In these mass cultural replays of the eternal dichotomy between good and evil ,  the use of highly symbolic black uniforms as an indicator of anonymous evil predominates .  Within the separate police forces ,  the nuances of uniform difference were always embroidered by real polises to produce symbolic boundaries from which to assess other uniform wearers .	None

1870	image	2	But surely it was right to warn the people ,  to make them feel their plight .  It was a time for fierce tactics ,  not for scruples .  But the scruples would spawn in his head , giving a cynical taint to his	image	of himself . He sighed tiredly ,  as though he had been working for a full day with stone and timber ,  and tried to listen to James Menzies ,  who was well away ,  drinking whisky with Allan and simmering with the news from the west ,  where the lists had been torn down from the church doors at Fortingall and Kenmore ,  and from Blair Atholl :  the Duke 's  factor had had to meet a crowd of more than a thousand and the Duke had signed a paper swearing not to impose the Act .

If they had said this about the Paris workmen ,  Louis would still be on the throne Through all the turnings of his thoughts one	image	dogged him Colberg 's face , so sharply carved , his eyes a wee bit slanting at the corners , his nostrils cut on a long shallow curve , his forehead not rounded but angled above the glossy black hairs at the outside ends of his eyebrows .

They prepared Cameron for his appearance in the High Court of Justiciary by one final interview ,  a dry recapitulation of what had been said before ,  with the slightest of hints that it would go well for him if he divulged something about the United Scotsmen ,  who evidently still preyed on their minds .

1873	image	2	Leonard Cohen is a man of medium height ,  five - feet ,  eight - inches  ( 173 cm )  ;  lean ,  with a rugged ,  world - weary face .  He looks like a man who should be heavier than he is ,  and one soon realises that an iron discipline keeps it that way .  He enjoys his food and wine , but disallows its enjoyment to distort the	image	which is important chiefly to himself , and then to his public . He is frequently described as having the stoop of an ageing crop - picker and the face of a curious little boy  which may have been true 30 years ago ,  but now belongs to the discard - tray with other caricatures :  caricatures ,  as Oscar Wilde observed ,  are compliments that mediocrity pays to genius .  Greying a little at the temples ,  Leonard unconsciously confirms why he is labelled one of Canada 's  sexiest men ,  a handsome and elegant man with dark eyes  ( they are said to be green ,  but that never showed in the light of Montreal ,  nor in its wintry sunshine )  .

1875	image	3	Omitting his radical change of direction  ( i.e. of subject )  in his second year ,  it represents a demand of surrealist proportions ,  especially when one considers that alongside these he was reading French ,  Latin ,  Mathematics ,  Philosophy and History .  His task ,  one of unending and heady excitement ,  was now well and truly under way !  Little wonder that he sometimes gave the impression of inattentiveness in class ; he was inebriated in a world of letters , engulfed by an avalanche of ideas and	images	, forms and metres , essays and critiques : a fast - changing , provocative kaleidoscope which took his already well - stocked and fertile mind to fresh heights . Paradise it was not ;  but at least it resembled something like its antechamber .  He plunged himself into all this and more ,  avidly reading everything that came his way ;  especially poetry ,  and not least Spanish ,  Chinese and Japanese poets in translation ,  but chiefly that of Federico Garia Lorca and W.B. Yeats ,  of whom he mused ,  I loved Yeats ;  his connections  ( such an important code - word with Leonard !  )  his rhythms .	None
1876	image	2	Layton described the four things which stand out in Leonard ,  which give him the confidence to work as he does ,  and promote his work :  The strong tradition of learning ;  the business entrepreneurship of his family ;  the broad philanthropy/charity which hall - marked it ;  and ,  lastly ,  the self - awareness that comes from being a Cohen  not understood as class - distinction ,  but from the high symbolism of the priest and his role .  This latter is particularly interesting .  It was raised by Dudek in somewhat different form when he said that Leonard always had an	image	of himself as a rabbi . We are talking of two very perceptive men  whose mtier is perception ;  and their recollection of Leonard at this young age ,  his late teenage years .  Layton put it somewhat differently when he added that the two great qualities a young writer has are his arrogance and inexperience ,  and on another occasion he picked out the twin characteristics of precocity and  independence .

1879	image	3	As I shall explain in the next section ,  this earlier privileging of intellect was intimately connected with resistance to nominalism ,  and ,  in the seventeenth century nominalism triumphed .  The emphasis on the mentality and immateriality of sense experience was associated with the denial that there was anything special about intellect .  Even whilst developing the modern immaterialist notion of consciousness , the eighteenth - century empiricists and others were attacking the dignity of intellect and assimilating it to sensory activity by treating thoughts as mere	images	. As well as being a defence of mind ,  therefore ,  the early modern philosophy ,  through its nominalism ,  was also an attack on it .  And ,  in certain important respects ,  the general form of this attack is preserved in contemporary physicalist theories .	None
1880	image	1	( See the discussions of these developments elsewhere in this book ,  particularly Chapters 4 and 7 .  )  And it has led to the introduction of new technologies for the direct investigation of the relationships between brain ,  behaviour and external events ,  the subject of the present chapter .  Most current procedures for recording the electrical activity of the brain , or producing radiographic	images	of the living human brain , or investigating the accuracy and timing of behaviour are dependent on computing capacity which was not available twenty years ago. But many of the techniques which computers are enabling us to exploit are not new .  By 1875 ,  the Liverpool physiologist Richard Caton had detected tiny fluctuations in voltages present on the surface of the brains or scalps of monkeys ,  cats and rabbits .	None
1881	image	1	So again ,  laboratory techniques were affording scientists a glimpse of their subjects '  mental lives .  The brain is not only an electrical machine ,  it also has a physical and chemical structure and these too are now being monitored in the living brain .  By using computers to integrate the information from a large number of different viewpoints round the skull , it is possible to visualize the appearance of a slice through the brain and build up a full three - dimensional	image	. The viewing medium can be X - rays ,  as in computerized tomographic  ( CT )  scans ;  magnetic resonance of atomic nuclei ,  as in nuclear magnetic resonance  ( NMR )  scans ;  or emission from radioactively labelled substances incorporated into the structure of nerve cells as in positron emission tomographic  ( PET )  scans .  These obviously have considerable clinical value for localizing and identifying areas of brain abnormality ,  but they also enable areas of activity in the normally functioning brain to be pictured .

These obviously have considerable clinical value for localizing and identifying areas of brain abnormality ,  but they also enable areas of activity in the normally functioning brain to be pictured .  The resolution of these pictures is still relatively coarse and they produce only a stationary	image	at a single moment in time . Nevertheless ,  they have demonstrated activity in the visual areas during an imaging task ,  in the language areas during a verbal task and even ,  on one  -  occasion ,  in the higher visual areas of a schizophrenic patient who subsequently reported that he had been hallucinating .  Remarkable as these observations are ,  they are currently only confirming what was known already about localization within the brain .	None

1884	image	5	She feels  imperialized ,  that everything familiar to her is being disturbed ,  the peace is being disturbed ,  and that our ways of telling  ( form )  and what we have to tell  ( content )  are simply not something that should be on an agenda of any kind .  Which is interesting because here the three of us are ,  thinking about what it means to belong somewhere ,  what it might mean to belong to this idea called theatre .  And we are discovering that we are not interested in exploring the finer points of alienation with tea cuppery , but that the theatre can be a bridge of bone between sickness and health that our language will somehow always be on the edge of poetry and that	image	and metaphor are our natural tools they best express whole worlds and histories in collision with each other.

Of how there are no accurate contemporary representations of her life ,  only this heritage stuff about happy agricultural labourers with straws in their mouths ,  or chirpy cockneys eating winkles .  She says she needs to gather up ,  in her post - modern skirt ,  all the creative ,  affirmative ,  intellectual parts of her childhood ;  she needs to know how her folk survived ,  and when she looks for them in England ,  on TV ,  at the theatre ,  in art galleries ,  in advertising ,  they 're invisible .

1887	image	2	WHAT PRICE THE FUTURE   by John Parsons  ( Daily Telegraph )  Seldom has Philippe Chatrier , a man renowned for his forthright views , especially whenever he has felt the advancement or the	image	of tennis was at risk , been quite so outspokenly blunt , as in his final Presidential newsletter he issued before ending his 14 year reign in charge ( which referred to in last month 's column ) at The International Tennis Federation . The focus of what could be seen as a heartfelt cry for commercial sanity to be restored to the sport centred upon one simple but now all - consuming issue  money !

1889	image	2	Marketing too underwent a revolution ;  old names  the Tournament at Paddington ,  the Golden Frame at Sheffield  were out ,  while in came the snappy new Quicksnack or Station Tavern that proudly proclaimed a new image nationwide .  Everywhere ,  too ,  customers were finding much nicer things to eat .  Sandwiches nearly 7 million sold on stations in 1985 lost their curly	image	; the new order was Tuna Cucumber , Salami Coleslaw , or BLT bacon , lettuce and tomato . The immediate success of these fillings ,  and the brown bread they came in ,  reflected John Bull 's  broadening palate .  As the 1980s progressed ,  seasoned travellers observed that the offerings of railway stations ,  airports and motorway service areas were growing more and more alike .	None

YOU'VE got to get rid of the males , David Gardner said with such fierce determination that he conjured up an	image	of concentration camps for male hops in remote parts of Kent .

1892	image	1	Some shots ,  particularly the front and rear covers of the book ,  are quite stunning .  But others are less impressive and I wonder how and why they made it through to the final selection .  The chapter on Annapurna contains several	images	which I felt were well below the overall standard . Perhaps they have lost something in the printing ,  but the reader will never know .

Her actions are unquestionably deedy ;  they bear no theoretical burden ,  unlike Kirillov 's  suicide ;  they run deeper  while she is on the job  than the paper person in her ,  and they make a rigid ,  final opposing of the profane midwife and the God - seeking husband academic and quite inadequate to the novel .  Nor does it get us anywhere to learn from Anna Dostoevsky 's Memoirs that the story of the frantic Shatov , where phrasing seems inevitable and	images	unsought it does n't help to be told by the novelist 's widow that these flawless pages lean heavily on his own behaviour while their first child was being born .

The main body of a bit image file consists of data bytes with bit mapping similar to figs 3 to 5 .  Bit	image	files normally have a fixed format header giving general information about the file and its format . One way to handle different bit mapping schemes is to include in the header details such as the number of bit planes ,  bits per pixel ,  pixels per scan line ,  and the number of scan lines .  This low level pixel oriented approach obviously makes sense for complex images with no formal structure ,  such as budgerigars .	None

1904	image	1	Since data compression relies on redundancy in the information to be compressed ,  performance is affected by the nature of the data .  There are various methods which can be used for  computer files  ( see box Getting quarts into pint pots )  .  Run Length Limitation ( RLL ) is probably the most common for bit	image	files , although the LZW algorithm is also in use .

1908	image	1	However high you choose this super resolution ,  the day will come when it 's  not enough .  Another point is that it would make most bit image files far longer than necessary .  The best scheme , by far , is to do what is normally done , ie . , write a bit	image	file in terms of the resolution available at the time it is created .

1918	image	1	Like video ram most graphics files support colour by ,  in effect ,  indexing into a look up table .  If a drawing description file refers to COLOUR 1 ,  the actual colour will be whatever colour 1 is set to .  Similarly , if a 16 colour bit	image	file format refers to red , green , blue and intensity planes , this will only be true of the default palette settings . However ,  it is quite common for graphics files to allow a colour table to be included ,  thus defining the palette .  A 16 colour PCX file header ,  for example ,  includes a 48 byte colour table .	None
1919	image	1	A 16 colour PCX file header ,  for example ,  includes a 48 byte colour table .  Each colour is defined by 3 bytes ,  one for each of the primary additive colours ,  red ,  green and blue .  Most printers are monochrome , but the often have a higher resolution than bit	image	date . Thus they can convert colour to a grey scale by a process called dithering .

1925	image	1	When wider bandwidth networking became available ,  the ability to move graphical information quickly around a network brought the cental multi user processor concept into the wimps era ,  and this has required clearly defined standards for the Graphical User Interface  ( GUI )  .

It is largely based on the bit	image	approach , and assumes a resolution of around 100 pixels per inch , which could become a limitation in the future .

1926	image	3	Eagleton 's  Althusserian phase of the mid - 1970s was strongly attacked by a Marxist academic ,  Kiernan Ryan ,  who has since taken issue with another Marxist ,  Alan Sinfield ,  on the extent to which the great literary works of the past can transcend the reactionary ideologies that produced them .  Sinfield believed that they were often irredeemably tainted by ideology ,  at best to be read only in historical terms ,  or subject to symptomatic readings ,  seeking the fractures and fissures in the mystified surface of the text that showed the true ideological conditions in which it was produced .  Against this , Ryan advanced the humanistic belief that the major canonical texts are not inherently reactionary , and that they contain implicit	images	and models of human freedom which transcend their immediate historical context and which later readers can respond to . This is an interestingly eclectic argument which recalls Gadamer on the fusion of horizons  ( the reader 's  and the text 's  )  ,  Marcuse on the utopian possibilities of high culture ,  and Sartre on the necessarily progressive implications of major literature .  Ryan represents a kind of Marxism that non - Marxists might do business with ,  in the sense that one can make a rational engagement with it .	None
1927	image	2	The real problem is that the writers of such texts may make political difficulties within a department ,  or teach in ways difficult for students to understand .  Again ,  English departments can be unhelpful about participating in schemes for training academics how to teach ,  claiming that teaching literature is less easily defined and methodologized than teaching engineering or economics .  At a time when a good public	image	is essential for universities , English is unable to explain itself in ways immediately intelligible to the outsider , is notoriously riven with doubts and disagreements that prevent it from having a shared sense of purpose , and may at intervals erupt into crises that attract the wrong sort of publicity . It is time ,  it is thought ,  for English to organize itself in ways that make it more like a proper academic discipline ,  with clear procedures and goals .  The adjacent social sciences provide the model for a genuine professionalism and accountability .	None
1928	image	2	It still seems to me that the acting critics of poesy are for the most part incapable of looking for more than one thing at a time ,  having got started about 1913  ( I mean a few of em got started about 1913 and a lot have started since )  to look for a certain plainness and directness of speech and simple order of words ;  and having about 1918 got started  looking for Mr Eliot 's  rather more fragile system  ( a system excellent for Mr Eliot but not very much use to any one else )  ,  they now limit their criticism to inquiring whether or no verse conforms to one or other of these manners ,  thereby often omitting to notice fundamentals ,  or qualities as important as verbal directness and even more important than snap .  The meaning of snap in relation to Eliot 's  rather more fragile system is at this date ,  I suppose ,  irrecoverable ;  but the general drift of these remarks is clear .  And this is not the only place in The Exile where Pound shows himself restive inside the	image	of himself that had been built up among initiates by his propaganda of fifteen years before , when he had taken over imagism and championed Ford Madox Ford 's ideas about a diction for poetry that should be plain and direct . At the end of this same issue of The Exile  there appears from Pound a page headed Desideria :  Quite simply :  I want a new civilization .	None
1929	image	5	It is n't a lack of the amorous ,  perhaps ,  so much as it is a completely different sense of the amorous to that which post - Christian man contains ,  to that which the likes of Duncan ,  say ,  or myself may feel .

Fire has to consume to give off its light .	None
1930	image	5	Ezra provided me with a standard ;  and gingered me into an attempt to train towards it .  Certainly it is the Pound of the London years ,  who had profited from Ford Madox Ford 's  pronouncements on diction ,  that Phyllis Bottome must have had in mind when she wrote :  The concrete	image	, unruffled by an adjective , was a thing Ezra would willingly have died for . Rhetoric  was a thing he would gladly have murdered ;  and he had already carried out his theory of honest thinking at the expense of considerable financial and perhaps emotional sacrifices .  His passionate and austere sincerity acted like a torch upon the young intellectuals of his day .	None
1931	image	2	In fact the original eighteen poems of the Hardy sequence ,   ( in the Collected Poems  of 1919 ,  he damagingly extended it by three extra pieces )  tell a story of the poet 's  pilgrimage to his and Emma 's  early haunts ,  matching the stages of the journey there and back to specific stages of Aeneas 's  journey ,  in Aeneid  6 ,  to the abode of the blest .  It thus represents ,  on the part of the supposedly non - modernist Hardy ,  a stratagem often taken to be definitively modernist :  the use of an ancient fable to structure and resonate with a twentieth - century narrative ,  as the Odyssey  structures and resonates with James Joyce 's  Ulysses  .  Yet so firmly established is the	image	of Hardy as a rustic provincial that Virgil rates not a single entry in the index to J.O . Bailey 's  700 - page Poetry of  Thomas Hardy ,  A Handbook and Commentary  ,   ( University of North Carolina ,  Chapel Hill ,  1970 )  .  Hardy undoubtedly read Virgil in the original ;  yet we know that long before he taught himself Latin his remarkable mother gave him  ( on his eighth birthday )  a copy of Dryden 's  translation of the Aeneid  .

1932	image	2	His mocking of his opponent ,  Lord Home ,  served not only to challenge the competence of the Establishment but equally to advertise the superior competence of Harold Wilson .  Wilson said it all when he said after half a century of democratic advance ,  the whole process has ground to a halt with a fourteenth earl .  He tagged the Tories with a grouse moor	image	and mocked Home for his matchbox economics . He used language ,  the politician 's  only weapon ,  to build a momentum for change sufficient to carry Labour to power on a modernising platform .

The party may have put on a collar and tie but it is still the Labour Party ,  prone to its old reflexes  ( as it reminded us yesterday on defence spending )  ,  prisoner still of its anachronistic structure ,  its mind set in 100 years of working -  class history .

It is now revealed to be Blue period  but one of the last paintings of this series .  It already uses the harlequin	image	which is characteristic of the Pink period paintings . The harlequin is enamoured of a young dancer who has been forced to marry the proprietor of the troupe .  She sits at the marriage banquet ,  apparently in a cafe ,  and the harlequin has just presented her with a bouquet .	None

The colour - printing facility ,  initially to be used only for advertising ,  may be used to produce a weekend leisure colour supplement early next year .  I do n't believe in the fatal decline of the written word , says Mr Fontaine , but we are competing all the time not so much against television , because the screen	image	and the printed word complement each other , as against magazines , and against the time people spend getting to work and then their leisure time against music and the cinema . Not all the Le Monde journalists support the change ,  which is the result of two years '  market research and several dummy editions .  A professional designer ,  Jean Bayle ,  with a track record for breathing new life into tired titles ,  was hired but the changes he favoured were deemed rather too radical and ,  in the end  as is often the case on Le Monde where the staff hold a significant stake in the company  the consensus view prevailed .

1941	image	3	Introducing Wired ,  his biography of John Belushi ,  Bob Woodward recalls how the rigours of research involved going to bed early so as to rise at 4am to visit one of the comedian 's  favourite watering holes .  Annotated ,  logged and indexed ,  his book scarcely illuminated Belushi 's  demons ,  or the system that supposedly destroyed him. But it did summon up the delicious	image	of the straitlaced reporter gingerly dipping his toe , notebook in hand , into the showbiz underworld . The film of Wired  ( 18 )  features Woodward  ( J T Walsh )  as straight man to the podgy comedian ,  but though subtitled the laughs and times of John Belushi ,  it is woefully short on the former component .  While the book charted his passage through Chicago ,  New York and finally Los Angeles ,  it largely skips the first two circles of hell .	None
1942	image	1	As the part requires an actor of substantial proportions ,  the obvious choice would be someone like John Candy or John Goodman  ( of David Byrne 's  True Stories and Channel Four 's  Roseanne )   though he may be simply too nice to play Ignatius ,  and is anyway busy perfecting his bowling technique for his upcoming appearance as Fred in the live - action version of The Flintstones .  From a slightly more elevated plane of cinematic endeavour comes news to warm the heart of Woody Allen .  Ingmar Bergman , who for some years now has been insistent that Fanny and Alexander was his farewell to the moving	image	, has decided to stage a come - back with a project called The Good Will . Set in Uppsala at the beginning of the century ,  it tells the story of Bergman 's  parents ,  and will be made for two different formats :  as a four - part series for televsion ,  and as two feature films for cinemas .  Unfortunately ,  Bergman has decided not to direct his own script ,  but has instead put it in the hands of the Danish director Bille August ,  who made Pelle the Conquerer ,  which won last year 's  Palme d'Or at Cannes and which Bergman is rumoured to like so much that he has already seen it six times .

East Germany 's  first organised opposition group ,  New Forum ,  its aims far from radical by comparison with those now being voiced in Poland and Hungary ,  was established last month even as the mass exodus began .  Jens Reich , one of its founders , said yesterday : There is much anger that the reality and the portrayed	image	are so different .  I think we have been silent too long ,  we 've tolerated too much for too long .

He wants to become the Thomas Mann of science fiction .  This dry contempt strolls out even when its target is invisible : the narrator telephones the Fonsteins ' house years after they have lost contact and is answered by a young man , on whom he forms an immediate	image	a thick head of hair , a beer paunch , a T - shirt with a logo or slogan .

Ministers will also be seeking to lift sagging Tory morale ,  by offering assurances on a range of issues ,  which promise to make this one of the most difficult annual conferences the party leadership has faced since Margaret Thatcher came to office .

Nicholas Ridley , Secretary of State for Trade and Industry , will open the attack on Neil Kinnock , the Labour leader today with a warning that the party could revert to its left - wing	image	, if it were elected . Kenneth Clarke ,  Secretary of State for Health ,  will offer reassurances on the changes to the National Health Service ,  with a strong defence of the policies for allowing hospitals to opt out ,  establishing an internal market and giving GPs practice budgets .

Toshack has taken pains to play down the hard - man	image	he brought from San Sebastian , swearing that the extra training ordered after the poor performance at Castellon was not a punishment . While Real are unbeaten ,  the relative honeymoon will continue for a man whom the late Bill Shankly ,  with characteristic caution ,  once said was destined to become the top manager in the game .

1957	image	2	From PETER PRINGLE in Washington AS THE post - mortem into the failed coup in Panama continued yesterday ,  it emerged that President Bush had approved an order to the US commander in the Canal Zone to remove General Manuel Noriega using covert forces ,  but the coup fizzled out before the order could be executed .  The debate is now focused on what the United States will do next time , if anything , to fulfil its declared policy of getting rid of General Noriega and avoid an	image	of timidity and indecisiveness when the chance comes . In a television interview ,  James Baker ,  the Secretary of State ,  said the Panama commander ,  General Maxwell Thurman ,  had been sent an order last Tuesday morning ,  the day of the coup ,  requiring him to seize General Noriega if there were an opportunity to do so without risking American life and without open military involvement ,  then he was free to go ahead .  The order was ,  in effect ,  an authorisation to plan a seizure ,  not to carry it out .	None

Until now ,  at least publicly ,  the society has played down the level of anxiety ;  it has resisted taking any action that could be seen as anti - government .

Only in the language  spoken with clarity throughout ,  especially by Simon Tyrrell as Macbeth ,  and Peter Granger - Taylor as Ross  does any slight consolation remain .  Across ashen , unredeemable scenes , Shakespeare 's words resound with redoubled force and humanity ; they sound almost ironic , in their fruitless reaching towards the	images	and emotions which have drained away from a soulless , monochrome universe . There are times when this universe seems excessively ,  even arbitrarily ,  bleak .

Nevertheless ,  she did give outright support to the stand taken by the Chancellor of the Exchequer .	None
1981	image	2	It is stories like these which help to protect Easton 's  policemen and women from the loss of morale which Manning claims is an inevitable result of the contradiction between the image the police have of themselves and their work and the low - key nature of practical policing  ( Manning 1977 :  349 ;  also see Holdaway 1983 ,  1988 ,  who makes a similar point )  .  The conceptualizations of police work that are found in Easton not only fit what is known of police forces elsewhere ,  they parallel the portrayal of policing in the wider culture .  The	image	of policing gleaned from police programmes on British and American television and in films is very much how Easton 's police see themselves , as others have commented with respect to police forces elsewhere ( Holdaway 1983 : 147 ; Hurd 1979 ; Klockars 1983 ; Morris and Heal 1981 ; Tuska 1979 ) . The popularity of these programmes among the section police in Easton is both cause and effect of the evaluations they make of their work .  The excitement ,  suspense ,  and danger which seems the lot of the police on celluloid feeds into the definitions many of Easton 's  section police give to their work experience ,  and the supposed similarity of this experience leads them to see police films and television programmes as an accurate portrayal ,  to be watched avidly because of this shared world .	None
1982	image	2	Those policemen who have racist views are faced with problems when the hero on celluloid is black ,  but when discussing such an instance ,  one policeman expressed his dislike for blacks but still found the film brilliant  ( FN 9/10/87 ,  p. 57 )  .  More importantly ,  this imagery affects the demeanour of these macho men when dealing with the public .  Sensitivity to public relations is not a quality which accompanies the Rambo self -	image	, and sergeants sometimes avoid placing the policemen who live out this imagery in situations where their insensitivity can damage public perceptions of the police . Various studies have shown that the public evaluate the police in terms of the attitude the police show them when they are victims in need of police help  ( for example ,  Jones 1983 ;  Maguire 1982 ;  Shapland 1982 ;  Southgate and Ekblom 1984 )  .  It is not always possible for low - ranking officers to anticipate the situations which Action Men need to avoid ,  and some instances were observed where the aggressive manner of the policeman acted as a form of amplification of deviance  ( Young 1971 )  ,  transforming a minor situation into big crime .	None
1983	image	2	Moving on loitering youths is a policing situation ripe for such amplification ,  as other research has shown  ( Southgate and Ekblom 1986 :  35 ,  37 ;  Young 1971 )  ,  and there were several occasions when policemen for whom this imagery is very important over - reacted to the presence of young people on street corners and were aggressive in the way they moved them on .  On one occasion the aggression was returned ,  resulting in the person being brought into the station and charged .  Of course , there are other situations when the toughness that accompanies the Rambo self -	image	is useful in disarming trouble - makers and preventing further crime , as happened more than once during field - work . The view of senior management is that policemen need to combine the qualities of compassion and toughness and know when each is appropri  ate  ( FN 11/11/87 ,  pp. 78 )  ,  although in practice it is difficult to strike this fine balance .  Where it is seen by work colleagues to be getting out of kilter ,  informal controls can be used to restore equilibrium .	None
1984	image	2	Once again the weight of television coverage had no effect on party credibility  ( though the nature of the coverage may have done so )  .  Public perceptions of party unity increased between our Pre - Campaign Wave and the start of the final campaign .  During the pre - campaign week we recorded no items on television news which positively projected the	image	of party unity . These rather artificial news items were very much the product of the final  election campaign .  In public perceptions the gap between Conservative unity and Labour unity narrowed sharply in the first few days of the campaign and again at the end ,  but actually increased very slightly in the third week .

Her course teacher has given her a reading list , and the library staff are good at helping students with all sorts of	interests	. As part of the course ,  she has to choose a subject of her own about which to write a paper ;  one of her difficulties is to know how to form her own views ,  not just copy already received opinions .  She is looking for critical views against which to pitch her own ;  it seems that she may have chosen the wrong sort of topic ,  since on a holiday in Italy she had been stunned by the newly renovated Michelangelo ceiling in the Sistine Chapel in Rome ,  and although there were plenty of books about it ,  many of them went into extravagant detail .

1993	interest	2	If the two girls compare notes one day ,  the New Yorker will complain about the useless articles she read ;  the newspaper articles were almost always short ,  written maybe by hard - pressed critics who were only allowed short articles ,  further cut down by sub - editors .  Still ,  by reading ,  and looking at Lee Krasner 's  pictures in New York galleries ,  she was able to defend an independent liking for her SoHo artist .  In London , it was a rather different story , since the literature available needed discrimination , much of it being historical and iconographic , establishing data of little	interest	to the art student . To her surprise ,  there proved to be perceptive judgements about qualities in Michelangelo 's  work ,  almost hidden in catalogue entries ;  more than one art historian ,  apparently ,  was not only learned but had an eye .   ART CRITICISM AND ART HISTORY	None
1994	interest	1	A further ,  and rather extreme way of dealing with a chronological survey of art is to eliminate the artists .  Art history without names was a phrase used by Heinrich Wlflinn ,  in his introduction to The Principles of Art History  first published in 1915 .  Wlflinn was Burckhardt 's successor as professor at Basel , but his later successful career took him to Berlin , Munich and Zrich , a major art historian whose	interests	were primarily in the Renaissance and the Baroque . Wlflinn was naturally not ignorant  of artists ,  but the famous phrase indicated an interest in the sequence of art seen as forms which develop as if of their own volition .  Wlflinn 's  writings are strong on observation ;  this can be understood from his choice of terms to describe tendencies in form ;  linear as against painterly ,  plane surface as against recessional depth ,  closed against open form ,  composite clarity against fused clarity ,  or absolute clarity against relative clarity .	None
1995	interest	2	Of course ,  surveys will continue to be written about American painting or German art ,  British sculpture or Australian print - making ;  this fact of publication does not mean that these activities have an inner coherence .  Any reader is entitled to ask what purpose such national anthologies serve ;  their best justification is making art more accessible ,  enabling those living artists represented to find and hold on to audiences for their work .  The reader can beware of an element of self -	interest	in such anthologies , whether in the form of books or exhibitions . For one thing ,  a government agency may have commercial or political aims in commissioning surveys or anthologies .  An international cultural agreement is made in parallel with a trading agreement ;  trade ,  it is hoped ,  will follow the art exhibition .	None
1996	interest	4	He concentrated on it because he loved it ,  and he thereby proved  once more his extreme simplicity of character .  For he had revealed one of the eternally popular effects of nature ,  one which is still quoted by simple people as a standard of visual beauty .  Animals make up a category of painting with an uneven reputation , though the theme is one of obvious importance and	interest	in sculpture . Animal Painting in Britain  was the title of a book by Basil Taylor ,  where he explained in his first chapter that the topic had been neglected since it was either assumed to be about sporting pictures ,  or about pictures of horses by such specialists as Sartorius .  He quoted the dismissive comment of the writer of the volume on British Painting 15301790  in the Pelican History of Art  :  To discuss the Sartorius tribe and such painters is no business of the historian of art ,  no matter how bitter the accusations of neglect are wont to be from those specialist writers who sometimes confuse the history of art with praising famous horses .	None
1997	interest	4	The Hudson memorial is not widely known ,  but the scope of this monograph is exemplary .  Similar treatment can be found in works on great monuments and schemes ,  perhaps especially in the Italian Renaissance ,  when such projects as the Sistine Chapel or Tintoretto 's  Scuola di San Rocco achieved a personal artistic unity of the highest standard .  for art historians , incomplete schemes or dismembered works such as altarpieces have the attraction of needing detective work ; but a critic takes an	interest	in a reconstruction only if it throws new light on surviving art . The main strength of this sort of monograph is its potential for detailed interpretation .  As a book on a single subject ,  there is a good chance that the need for description will be reduced by extensive illustration ,  while a favourable judgement on the work has already been implied by the choice of the subject for a monograph .	None
1998	interest	4	The collaboration of artists with the stage was also brought to a high point by Serge Diaghilev ,  in his commissions to artists for the Russian Ballet .  This connection between painting and the theatre was important to earlier European art in religious as well as secular performances .  Critics no less than artists have wide	interests	in the arts , and may introduce comparisons in their interpretations . In the nineteenth century to say that a picture was poetic was a common term of praise .  In the present century emphasis on formal qualities in the visual arts have made musical comparisons more frequent ,  emphasised by the use by artists of musical terminology ,  as when Kandinsky chose to call his works Improvisations and Compositions .

2000	interest	1	Carritt bought it ,  correctly identified it as a lost early work ,  and magnanimously sold it to the National Gallery ,  London ,  far below the market price .  Auction catalogues do not carry critical comments on individual items for sale ,  but there are sometimes introductions with criticism .  An example is the catalogue of paintings by Nol Coward , which was prefaced by a memoir of the playwright , describing his	interest	in painting . In marketing a sale of rather little - known works ,  too ,  there may be some explanatory text .  It would be wrong to dismiss this sort of criticism as mere sales talk ,  particularly in grand auctioneers '  catalogues ,  though there is little danger of such publications being reticent .	None
2001	interest	3	A profile of the artist is another form in which to review an exhibition .  When such an article rises above the level of a gossip column ,  the artist 's  profile can be a valuable format .  One source of	interest	can be a description of where the interview has taken place , perhaps a studio , or maybe the artist 's home . After the Second World War ,  for example ,  the photographer Alexander Liberman decided to visit the studios of artists who had contributed to a century of painting in France ,  painters and sculptors closely connected with the School of Paris .  He commented on his project :  The more I explored ,  the more I became absorbed with the mystery of the environment .	None

Tom Taylor ,  mentor and leader ,  had died before the group had its first exhibition ,  but remains classed with his friends .  They subsequently developed individual styles and separate	interests	, as is true of most groups of artists , but their initial appearance was defined by a programme . Another sort of title for a group is exemplified by Der Blaue Reiter   ( The Blue Rider )  .  Forty - three works by fourteen painters were shown in 1911 at the First Exhibition by the Editorial Board of The Blue Rider  ,  the publication concerned being an almanac which appeared in 1912 with a drawing of a horseman by Kandinsky on the cover .

He has extracted land and money from business	interests	, but his revolutionary experiment has foundered from the start . Nathaniel Hawthorne spoke of the phantasmagorical antics he had played in describing the socialist community which appears in The Blithedale Romance  :  the antics played in the commune conceived by Ahmed could also be called phantasmagorical .  A nut - brown man by South Kensington standards ,  he is light - skinned in the West Indies :  he is a Chinese Negro ,  who thinks of himself as a hakwai  Chinee  hakwai  ,  he explains ,  being Chinese for nigger  and who has not failed to notice that Emily Bront 's  Heathcliff is rumoured to be the Emperor of China .

He has travelled from the liberated past , when imagination took power , to the liberation of an	interest	in fact a state which may or may not prove to have been , for Roth , partial or provisional , and which The Facts , in its totality , manages to enclose in an ironised uncertainty . He can look here at times a little like a man who has taken the first steps in a descent from the high ground of Self - consciousness ,  impersonality ,   fantastication  and ironic indirection  not that this has lately been ,  or has ever been ,  literature 's  only ground .

2014	interest	2	In particular the protestant bloc lost the Southern protestant landowning gentry .  The two alliances were ascribed territories in which to produce their social structures ,  political institutions ,  coercive bodies ,  informal and interpersonal networks of maintaining influence ,  and more clearly defined hegemonic cultures .  The two societies gave expression to their own dominant	interests	as far as possible unhindered by each other 's interference . The process was assisted in the North by the self - exclusion of Britain from internal Ulster affairs by setting up the Stormont parliament which survived from 1922 to 1972 .  Protestant  loyalist domination ,  successor to the ascendancy ,  was circumscribed to one corner of Ireland while the catholic  nationalist alliance asserted total domination in the remainder .	None
2015	interest	5	While the party contains many who actively seek peace and reconciliation ,  it would be wrong to think of them in any sense as overcoming the basic conflictual components of bloc power in Ireland .  Castle catholics ,  those who found a place in the Stormont administration and developed a stake in the union ,  have also voted alliance ,  but are probably now ,  in 1989 ,  switching their allegiance to the newly found conservative associations ,  which are seeking to bring British party loyalties to Ulster .  The Northern Ireland statelet was founded on an alliance between the protestant loyalists of Ulster and British imperial and capital	interests	, particularly as represented by the conservative party . But that is what the arrangement was :  an alliance rather than a consolidated interest or a genuinely shared culture .  Protestant loyalists dominated the statelet from its formation .	None
2016	interest	2	At least up to 1985 ,  the British government submitted to the threat of violence from the loyalist community and accepted the protestant  loyalist veto on any change in the constitutional structure of their state .  With the Anglo - Irish Agreement at Hillsborough in 1985 ,  it has sought to lay aside that veto ,  and establish in principle its political right to modify the structure of power and control in Ulster by involving the Republic of Ireland in a common policy on security .  However , in the	interests	of Western European stability and its own financial position , the British government is perhaps still putting off the final offer either British withdrawal or some form of power - sharing with catholic nationalists in the hope of loyalists coming round to what is seen as a more reasonable position . The class structure of Northern Ireland is predictably dominated by protestants .  Of course ,  with the development of international monopoly capital and multinational companies ,  additional sources of power have been brought into play .	None
2017	interest	2	Their small church membership of around 10,000 hides the wider appeal Paisleyite politics has for the small businessmen and farmers of protestant Ulster .  The setting up of a new form of Ulster Club organization involving paramilitary activity in the wake of the Anglo - Irish accord of 1985 ,  is an added dimension to the struggle for power within the alliance .  It is likely that the inner core of local church laity , such as select vestry members of the Church of Ireland and presbyterian elders , provided and still provide one of the links between the material and spiritual	interests	of the groups in the alliance , as these laity were and are active in the business and commercial fields also .

2018	interest	4	Added upset came in the same year from a speech by Dr W. Starkie ,  the commissioner of National Education in Ireland ,  who attacked school managers for not being up to their job .  The attack was within the context of a speech largely praising the Roman catholic church in Ireland .  But the church 's clerics still took offence , particularly at the point that local people should be encouraged to take an	interest	in the schools by having some financial responsibility for them through local government . As priests controlled the local school directly ,  this was seen to be a direct attack on their role in the school system .  Eventually the Irish party was forced to return to Westminster to see to it that the appropriate denominational interests in England were strengthened and to show the Irish political leadership 's  compliance with the similarly organized Irish system  ( Miller 1973 :  7785 )  .

2020	interest	2	The bishops were successful in urging the Irish party to accept the church 's  programme for Irish education as a whole .  Their success was founded on a dual strategy .  On the one hand they subscribed to the annual Irish parliamentary party fund and , on the other , they publicly praised the Irish party as the true political representatives of the Irish people and its	interests	in the British parliament . Even a Castle bishop such as Archbishop Healy ,  now announced his conversion to the nationalist cause .  In other words ,  support for the education policies of the church were the quid  the Irish party had to give in order to obtain the quo  of the bishops '  endorsement of the party as the genuine political representatives of the Irish people or nation .

2028	interest	3	Indeed what we are now seeing in some cases as the genuine article are quality brewery refurbishments dating from the 1920s and 1930s ,  good Brewers Tudor ,  maybe ,  but hardly the stuff of the ancient ,  inglenooky world that the modern myth - makers  the brewers and the tourism industry  would have us believe still exists .  Most of York 's  old central pubs have fallen victim to drastic recent remodelling with yawning spaces ,  often indistinguishable from one pub to another ,  replacing the old rooms and idiosyncratic nooks and corners that previously gave individuality and preserved genuine historic character .  That two dozen of these interiors are in buildings statutorily listed for their special architectural or historic	interest	say much for the low regard paid to pubs in the exercise of listed building control and indeed for the listing process itself . A striking example of this is the list description for The Blue Bell in Fossgate ,  the last perfectly - surviving Victorian pub interior in York and one of only two pubs left in the city of truly national importance .  The premises is described as follows ;	None
2029	interest	2	History ,  indeed ,  tends to show that public intervention can have the effect of reinforcing rather than curbing market excesses .  It was the licensing system and licensing controls ,  after all ,  which helped to foster Britain 's  peculiar brewery tie and concentrate pub ownership in the hands of the brewers in the first place ;  and it was the same system which connived at and partly encouraged the modern contagion of open - plan pub designs .  In addition , the 1989 MMC Report , conceived as an attack in the public	interest	on the monopoly power of the major brewers and requiring the untying of large chunks of their tied estates , may have devastating consequences for traditional pubs . For despite their other shortcomings ,  most of the major brewers have been able and willing to cross - subsidise many less profitable houses .  Equally ,  the brewery - tie system has sheltered much pub property in tied tenancies from the harsh winds of the Market .	None
2030	interest	3	Her ale ,  if new ,  looks like a misty morning ,  all thick  .  During the 20th century an historic architectural character  perhaps most typically that of the timber framed building  has become popular with ,  and desirable to ,  both publicans and brewers .  In many cases this has resulted in the introduction of faked features and the associated destruction of existing features which , though often of architectural and historic	interest	in their own right , do not fit in with the designer 's concept of the pub 's ideal form . Artificial plastic beams are frequently introduced ,  ceilings are stripped of plaster to reveal floor joists that were never intended to be seen ,  other timbers are artificially blackened to create a supposedly traditional though in fact inauthentic black and white effect and render or plaster is removed from walls to produce rustic charm .  At the Saracen 's  Head at Towcester ,  for example ,  a recent proposal to historicise the pub involved extensive destruction of genuine historic fabric and the introduction of the worst cliches of traditional pub detail ,  such as bulls - eye glass and copper lanterns .	None
2031	interest	3	Although the loss of the original front is regrettable ,  the present facade is in accord with the general architectural character of the street and retains original late - Georgian features ,  such as its sashes with glazing bars .  The pub 's  owner ,  however ,  wished to remove the 19th century facade and undertake a conjectural restoration of the jetted ,  timber framed front  ( the design of which included various historically inaccurate details )  .  The public clearly believed that this restoration would enhance the building 's	interest	despite destroying an historic element ; he must also have felt that a new timber framed facade , despite its inauthenticity , would give the pub an historic character that was more readily recognisable and instantly attractive to potential customers . If pub owners were prepared to emphasise the interest of genuine historic features ,  regardless of period ,  then this type of fakery ,  which disappoints or sadly deceives the customer in search of the traditional pub and irreparably removes much of a building 's  interest for future generations ,  could be avoided .

2033	interest	3	An additional problem faced by many Georgian pubs  particularly historic coaching inns  is the treatment of re - use of stables and other related outbuildings .  As Matthew Saunders noted in the 1983 SAVE/CAMRA Report :  The freestanding stable wing , the coachmen and ostlers accommodation , the skittle alley and cobbled yard can be of the greatest	interest	and yet are very vulnerable to the ubiquitous need , often enforced by the planning authorities , for adequate car parking space . Indeed such is the pressure for adequate car parking that there are a surprising number of cases where brewing companies have applied for permission to demolish not only outbuildings but adjacent cottages ,  some of them listed   A number of the larger Georgian pubs originally accommodated outbuildings to the rear .	None
2034	interest	2	The multi - roomed and historically - eclectic pub needs to be protected against the ravages of the all - over designer look .  As has been frequently pointed out ,  it is no use providing excellent beer or food if the pub in question has lost all of its charm and atmosphere ;  and surely a multi - roomed pub ,  with a number of differing environments ,  is the best way to serve what is after all always a very diverse and unstandardised community .  In 1976 the Lord Chief Justice , dismissing Bass Charrington 's appeal against a proposal to open up the interior at the Romans Hotel in Southwick , Sussex , declared that it might be undesirable in the public	interest	to see more public bars disappearing and more mergers of public and saloon bars of the kind in question here In addition ,  far better liaison needs to be established between the breweries and local authority Conservation and Planning Officers ,  English Heritage ,  the National Amenity Societies ,  local civic bodies and ,  of course ,  pub landlords and their clientele over planned pub refurbishments .  In particular ,  licensing magistrates and fire and health authorities should be made more aware of the character and needs of historic buildings .	None
2035	interest	4	The inter - war period saw the construction of a large number of new pubs to serve the needs of growing suburban communities and reconstructed city centres .  These usually reflected Tudor or Georgian styles ,  sometimes with intentional accuracy ,  more often in an impressionistic way .  The spread of motoring caused a revival of	interest	in the tradition of wayside coaching inns , since these were rediscovered as charming nostalgic examples of bygone days , and the charm of the wayside inn was celebrated in the verses of Hilaire Belloc and Rupert Brooke . Running a modern - day coaching inn became a fashionable activity after the painter John Fothergill took on the Spread Eagle at Thame in the 1920s and ,  later ,  the Three Swans at Market Harborough .  A melancholic figure dressed in black ,  he seems to have specialised in overhung jugged hare and insults to his customers .	None
2036	interest	4	E. Midlands shows worry over UBR A SURVEY of the tourism industry in the East Midlands has highlighted concern over the Uniform Business Rate  ( UBR )  .  And with 1992 and the dismantling of trade barriers within Europe fast approaching , the spring East Midlands Tourism Business Survey also reveals a disturbing lack of	interest	in language training . The survey ,  sponsored by Pannell Kerr Forster ,  the East Midlands Tourist Board  ( EMTB )  and Nottingham Polytechnic showed that 63 %  of all hotels in the region believed the UBR had a detrimental effect on business .  And among medium - sized hotels with a turnover of between 100,000 and 1m ,  54 %  were concerned about the impact of the UBR .	None

This is of course in our own	interests	. Training on - site can cost anything in the range of 200 to 350 per day .

What I find extraordinary is how each tree seems almost to suggest its own companion planting .  On reflection , however , this may not be quite true , since anyone who sets out to plant a wildlife garden instinctively takes a much keener	interest	in , and is influenced by , natural plant associations and communities . In my own garden the twisted hazel ,  Corylus avellana  Contorta ,  is underplanted with primroses ,  bluebells and wood anemones ,  for that is how I remember them growing ,  as they still do ,  along the banks of the rive Greta .

HO Circular  ( 194/78 )  describing British and American research literature on policing is another typically apologetic ,  anti - intellectual document ,  for within its first few paragraphs it admits :  the implication of attempting to establish a central research information centre to give advice to chief officers about research findings , or collect , collate and distribute research of	interest	to the police service , and maintain an up - to - date index of research would be very considerable .

2058	interest	2	The form continues ,  listing other sections of the Act .  It makes it abundantly clear that even the possession  and academic presentation of information necessary for an ethnography could be actionable .  For a considerable amount of inconsequential information owned by the institution is classed as confidential , even though its release could only be considered prejudicial to the safety and	interests	of the state by the most bigoted autocrat . The need to get the retiring member to sign such a document indicates the institutional fear of the outside lying behind the threats which Sir Peter Imbert issued to those who would write controversial memoirs  ( Police Review  ,  26 August 1988 )  ;  for the family demands silence unto death from its members !  And even if an uncommissioned but critical ethnography is not considered to be in breach of the Official Secrets Act ,  it will most likely be construed as structural espionage and lie in breach of the Police Discipline Code as set out in Police Regulations .

Zoology ,  the joker in his pack ,  offered in his final year ,  also achieved 62 per cent .  Perhaps the choice was his way of declaring his consuming	interest	in life , not learning , which was becoming an obsession .

2069	interest	4	Here is Piaget 's  most well - known demonstration of the infant 's  failure to relate actions to experiences .  At about seven months of age the average baby is quite skilled at removing obstacles to prehension ;  is well able ,  for example ,  to pull a cushion away to reach a rattle behind it .  However , if the rattle slips down so far that it is no longer visible , the infant will at once lose	interest	and behave as if the rattle had also slipped out of existence . By about eight months of age most infants are capable of retrieving completely hidden objects ;  but between eight and twelve months they show another intriguing pattern of errors .

2075	interest	4	Sadly he died shortly afterwards and for many reasons it was some months before I used the disc .  The advent of the Arbortech Carving Competition at the 1990 Woodworker Show gave me the idea of putting the tool to some good use .  My grandfather had always taken a keen	interest	in my work , and I had an equal admiration of the stories of his time spent in Burma during the Second World War . Therefore it seemed fitting that as a tribute to him and his comrades I produce a sculpture with this tool .  The strongest image I got from his stories and subsequent research was of the oppressive jungle and heat in which the soldiers fought .	None

He read several papers before the society and his published works include observations on the laws of electricity ,  the height to which rockets can be fired and the influence which two pendulum clocks ,  in close proximity ,  were seen to have on each other. His intellect and range of	interests	were wide and profound . He died in 1772 .  The Anniversary Organising Committee had felt that a clock should be commissioned to replace the one which had been stolen ,  and perhaps because I have for some years specialised in the reproduction of historic clocks ,  my name was one of those considered .

2078	interest	6	At the end of August the first arbitration case was decided upon .  The arbitrator stated that the elderly couple in question had been sold an unsuitable product and had not been given adequate risk warnings .   However , in making his award , the arbitrator subtracted those moneys ( plus	interest	) already received by the couple , who were awarded 9,000 against their current building society debt of 18,000 . At the time of writing it appears that the broker in this case has gone into liquidation without making the required payment ,  and the couple must now turn to the Investors '  Compensation Scheme ,  which can pay compensation in cases where  ( a )  the broker has gone into liquidation ,  and  ( b )  the original investment was taken up about 28 August 1988 .  A number of the 150 people who have contacted Age Concern England about the debt they face took up their scheme before this date and will not be able to obtain compensation even if they are granted an award through arbitration or private legal action .

Retirement allowed him the time to pursue his botanical	interest	, often in company with his children and grandchildren , between whom and Evan the devotion was mutual .

2091	interest	4	The notebooks show Svidrigailov developing from a minor into a major character while Crime and Punishment  was being planned and written ,  and they show his growth as interdependent with Raskolnikov 's  final definition .  In some early drafts Raskolnikov commits suicide ,  and the striking thing here is that it 's  never suggested he does so out of remorse or because he thinks he 's  going to get caught or even from some vaguer ,  larger self - loathing .  He appears to lose	interest	in life . He is bored .  Sonya asks him ,  I do n't understand :  how will things be for you ,  how will you marry and have children    of course thinking about his estrangement from human kind ;  and he replies  ( Dostoevsky 's  italics )  :   I 'll get used to it  .

The total component of the earth 's  magnetic field in the UK is around 47 000 gamma inclined at around 67 to the horizontal .

2094	interest	3	Measuring current with light Another area of activity for King 's  is in fibre optics .  Research projects presided over by professor Alan Rogers include the identification of large molecules , such as those of	interest	in medical tests , the production of fibre lasers , and the design of distributed measuring systems . One of the projects close to commercial realisation uses optical fibre to sense a current flowing in a conductor .  The interesting part is that the measuring fibre does not need to be part of the current carrying circuit ,  giving a high degree of electrical isolation .	None
2095	interest	3	However ,  when the fibre is put into a spatially varying magnetic field ,  a phenomenon called Faraday rotation comes into play .  This effectively changes the polarisation direction ,  and can cause coupling between the two modes .  So , if the current of	interest	can be made to produce a magnetic field which varies in the right way along the length of the fibre , this can be used to measure current . Danny McStay and Welland Chu are the researchers working on the project .  They have devised several ways of producing the required magnetic field ,  including a slotted busbar  ( such as might be used in a power station )  around which the fibre can be wrapped .	None

Kermode recalls the seminars as occasions of good humour and tolerance ,  despite sharp intellectual disagreements ,  and he laments that their humane spirit did not survive later events .  By the late seventies some British academics were displaying a wary but sympathetic	interest	in early or classical structuralism , particularly as it was expounded in Culler 's widely read Structuralist Poetics , a lucid , urbane work which suggested that structuralism might , without too much difficulty , be adopted to existing academic practice . I was partly convinced by Culler 's  power of persuasion ,  and for some time thought that the kinds of analysis he described could be assimilated to practical criticism and the English synthesis .  Eventually I decided that assimilation was not possible ,  given Culler 's  lack of interest in the interpretation of particular texts and his commitment to the uncovering of the generalized principles of literariness .

In Structuralist Poetics  Culler took an unenthusiastic view of deconstructionism ,  but he shortly  returned to the United States and succumbed to the deconstructive wave that swept through the American academy in the late seventies ,  and into which I did not feel inclined to plunge .  David Lodge was another established British academic and writer who took an early interest in formalist and structuralist methods and principles .	None
2098	interest	2	Hawkes had dismissed the ideas of objectivity and truth in Structuralism and Semiotics  ,  but Nuttall insists that such dismissals are pragmatically self - refuting .  We may assert that there is no such thing as truth ,  but we regard that as a true statement .  The point has a particular relevance to the work of those who believe , like Foucault , following Nietzsche , that truth is a mere rhetorical device , employed in the	interests	of oppression , and say so at length . What then is the status of Foucault 's  saying so   Nevertheless ,  the very concept of truth seems to be an irritant for some .	None
2099	interest	4	Furthermore ,  attacks such as Crews 's  are ,  as he acknowledges ,  not taken seriously and replied to in their own terms ,  but treated as symptoms of repressed disturbance .  Freudians ,  like Marxists ,  cannot step outside their own forms of thought to admit that they might be wrong  ( unless ,  like Crews ,  they undergo a deconversion )  .  The recent revival of	interest	in psychoanalysis among literary theorists has come from France , and in particular from the work of Jacques Lacan , who brought together Freud and Saussure and produced the slogan , the unconscious is structured like a language . Lacan has been very influential ,  although he is an almost impenetrably obscure writer .  The obscurity is not incidental ,  a product of carelessness or incompetence in writing ,  but a deliberate attempt to enact  the wayward processes of the unconscious .	None
2100	interest	3	At the same time ,  there is an ambiguity in this backwards opening of the canon .  Much of the work that is rediscovered may have the literary qualities that will satisfy readers without particular feminist interests :  the poems by women that Roger Lonsdale included in The New Oxford Book of Eighteenth - Century Verse  are a small - scale ,  easily accessible instance .  Nevertheless , in a feminist academic context writing may well be studied , not primarily for its literary but for its cultural	interest	. This question provoked arguments in America about the Norton Anthology of Literature by Women  ,  some of the contents of which were said to have had little value as literature .  A common feminist response is to say that the whole idea of literary standards ,  even standards as such ,  is a form of male domination .	None
2101	interest	4	He remained some kind of Marxist ,  and his concept of the carnivalesque ,  drawn from Rabelais ,  was presented as a mode of ideological subversion ,  a pulling down of the mighty from their seats .  It will take time for the implications of his work to be properly assimilated and understood ;  the process involves transposition from a cultural context that is more remote than the French .  But the growing	interest	in it suggests that it offers both a possible way out of present impasses and a way forward .

2102	interest	3	Non - evaluative criticism ,  as propounded by the successive Merton professors ,  Gardner and Carey ,  has long been a popular ideal at Oxford .  But another Oxford professor ,  John Bayley ,  sees things differently .  Discussing a book on Dostoevsky , he remarks that while the author has much of	interest	to say about The Idiot she does not quite persuade one that it comes off , indeed she does not really try , because like many scholars today she is more concerned with showing how the thing works than with judging if it works well . From the beginning academic literary study was divided between those who saw it as inevitably involved with making judgements and those who did not. Cambridge English represented the former :  Richards and Leavis wanted an evaluative criticism ,  because they did not believe that literature was simply a matter of disinterested individual response ;  it was an index to the condition of civilization ,  which made judgements imperative .	None
2103	interest	2	Venturing to propound a law of intellectual life ,  I suggest that evaluative criticism enters institutional literary study under the influence of practising writers ,  or of critics who have a close discipular relation to them ,  but that in time it is rejected ,  like an alien organ .  Writers ,  whose criticism arises directly from the problems and possibilities of their art ,  are inevitably evaluative ;  Baudelaire showed how being a poet also involves being a critic .  Eliot 's early and best criticism was what he called workshop criticism , an attempt to realign literary tradition in the	interests	of the kind of poetry he wanted to write . Leavis ,  at the beginning of his career a whole - hearted admirer of Eliot ,  took over Eliot 's  tentative critical models and systematized them .  Later he responded in a similar way to D. H. Lawrence 's  criticism ,  as well as to his creative achievement .	None

How can all that knowledge be condensed into a fifty - minute lecture to students who know almost nothing about it   The	interests	of scholarship and pedagogy are at odds here . What Roby ,  likes to do is to deconstruct the texts ,  to probe the gaps and absences in them ,  to uncover what they are not  saying ,  to expose their ideological bad faith ,  to cut a cross - section through the twisted strands of their semiotic codes and literary conventions .  What the students want her to do is to give them some basic facts that will enable them to read the novels as simple straightforward reflections of reality ,  and to write simple ,  straightforward ,  exam - passing essays about them .	None
2105	interest	4	He had done his initial research on jane Austen ,  but since then had turned his attention to topics as varied as medieval sermons ,  Elizabethan sonnet sequences ,  Restoration heroic tragedy ,  eighteenth - century broadsides ,  the novels of William Godwin ,  the poetry of Elizabeth Barrett Browning and premonitions of the Theatre of the Absurd in the plays of George Bernard Shaw .  None of these projects had been completed .  Seldom , indeed , had he drawn up a preliminary bibliography before his attention was distracted by some new or revived	interest	in something entirely different . He ran hither and thither between the shelves of Eng .  Lit .  like a child in a toyshop  so reluctant to choose one item to the exclusion of others that he ended up empty - handed .	None
2106	interest	3	What better inspiration could a literature of theory have than an audience composed of theorists and critics   This is not ,  I think ,  meant to be ironical ,  and it represents a quite logical development from the premiss that the whole production ,  definition ,  and reception of literature has now become intramural to the academy .  In this context , what goes on outside , what is actually written by poets and novelists , is of minor	interest	. Paul de Man is reported to have said that a  literary work is merely an event in the history of interpretation .  A natural response to this state of affairs would be to say that theory cut off from the writing of literature is no more than a sterile academicism .	None
2107	interest	3	Dempsey in Changing Places  and Small World  is an approximate British equivalent .  )  Zapp wants the subject to be organized ,  systematic ,  objective ,  in a word  though it is not a word he uses  scientific .  There is to be no nonsense about value , preferring some books or authors to others , or personal responses , which have a merely anecdotal or autobiographical	interest	. Working on Jane Austen was not all that different from working on trade cycles ,  or lowtemperature physics ;  these were the kind of things that went on in the modern university .  Admittedly ,  in his later appearances Zapp has gone poststructuralist ,  and abandoned system and objectivity ;  but his commitment to professionalism is greater than ever .	None
2108	interest	4	An awkward truth though is that in the twentieth century some of the most committed political criticism has come from conservatives ,  like Eliot and the Southern Agrarians .  An erudite work by an Oxford New Historicist ,  David Norbrook 's  Poetry and Politics in the English Renaissance  ,  illustrates the structuralist truism that in a binary grouping one of the two terms tends to assume dominance .  Norbrook 's	interest	is clearly far more in politics than in poetry . The most significant aspect of the New Historicism ,  political questions apart ,  is that it represents a move away from the contextless ,  intensive concentration on particular texts equally characteristic of the New Criticism ,  classical structuralism ,  and deconstruction .  This has major pedagogic implications ,  since students can no longer hope to make sense of poems or plays just by reading them carefully ,  but must spend time in libraries getting up on the historical context .	None
2109	interest	3	I am very sympathetic to it ,  and have tried to put it into effect in some of my own writing ,  but there is an accompanying danger that literature becomes absorbed by culture ,  and that literary values are superseded by cultural ones .  This may seem innocuous and acceptable ,  but the implications should be understood .  The kind of poem that a literary critic would regard as banal , ill - written , shallow in feeling , and platitudinous in sentiment , might have major human	interest	for the cultural historian . Granted that there is an absolute need for humanistic values to prevail in a neo - utilitarian and materialistic age ,  one is faced with a significant divergence in the nature of these values .  The experience of reading major works of literature can have an overpowering effect on the responsive reader  ( usually ,  but by no means invariably ,  the young reader )  .	None
2110	interest	4	Malcolm Bradbury 's  story ,  The Adult Education Class ,  nicely dramatizes the difficulties and dangers .  Adult classes ,  in fact ,  require exceptionally good teaching ,  of a kind that may be remote from the professional ideals of many presentday academics .  At the present time , there is much	interest	in the English past , evoked in exhibitions commemorating historical events , and evident in the spread of museums and the great popularity of visiting country homes . This interest has several aspects .  One of them ,  as the Left disapprovingly points out ,  is a mythologized version of past greatness which obfuscates the disagreeable realities of the present .	None
2111	interest	4	The Michelin Guide to the Cte de l'Atlantique  says that this eerie and impressive cavern ,  which communicates by a passage through the cliff to the chteau on the summit ,  was probably made in the twelfth century to shelter the relics of the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem brought back from a Crusade by Pierre II of Castillon ,  who at that time held the chteau .  Now Pound has interested himself a great deal in the order of the Templars ,  to which Pierre of Castillon belonged .  In fact it is the Templars , some of whose ritual survives in the practices of modern Freemasonry , who account for Pound 's	interest	in Poitiers , one of their principal centres . In the thirteenth century the King of france ,  abetted by a weak Pope ,  very brutally suppressed the Order of Templars and appropriated their enormous wealth .  The Grandmaster of the Order at this time was Jacques de Molay .	None
2112	interest	3	It would be tedious to quote and consider every one of the tributes that Pound paid to Binyon .  One is at the end of Gaudier - Brzeska   ( 1916 )  ;  another is in a Criterion  article of 1937 ,  D'Artagnan Twenty Years After ;  in that year appeared Polite Essays  ,  which includes Pound 's  review of Binyon 's  translation of the Inferno   ( originally  in The Criterion  for April 1934 )  ;  there are two tributes to Binyon in Guide to Kulchur   ( 1938 )  ;  in 1948 at St Elizabeth 's  Pound was still pressing Binyon on the attention of Charles Olson ;  and as late as 1958 he took the opportunity of Pavannes and Divagations  to get back into print his appreciative note on The Flight of the Dragon  .  None of these items is without	interest	. But Hell ,  the review of Binyon 's  Inferno  ,  is particularly important ;  for it may well be one of the most careful and illuminating acts of criticism that Pound ever performed .  It includes this passage :	None

In both arguments , the next two weeks which include a probable German	interest	- rate rise and an unavoidable Conservative Party conference will be critical . If Mr Lawson can hold off a base rate rise at least until he can blame the Germans ,  that will make his political task a fraction easier ;  but not much .

As a massive lender which takes no deposits , a marketer of industrial and consumer finance , and increasingly a purveyor of insurance - related products to an under - insured French public , CB probably embodies a unique combination of strategy and	interests	.

Lord Donaldson said objectives due to be included in this autumn 's  Bill were total freedom of choice for the client ,  unless the interests of justice otherwise require .  When those concerned turn their attention to this problem , they may find they have to make a distinction between litigation in which there is a direct public	interest	is limited to ensuring that an adequate system of justice is available . In the first category we have criminal cases ,  judicial review and cases which involve matrimonial status and the welfare of children or those under a disability .  In many of them ,  particularly criminal cases ,  the interests of the client may be quite different from those of the public .	None
2121	interest	2	When those concerned turn their attention to this problem ,  they may find they have to make a distinction between litigation in which there is a direct public interest in the result and that in which the public interest is limited to ensuring that an adequate system of justice is available .  In the first category we have criminal cases ,  judicial review and cases which involve matrimonial status and the welfare of children or those under a disability .  In many of them , particularly criminal cases , the	interests	of the client may be quite different from those of the public . In these cases the interests of justice may demand special requirements such as ,  for example ,  that the preparation and presentation of the case be in separate and independent hands .  In the second category ,  general civil cases ,  parties should be able to choose their own lawyers because the interests of justice would be inherently less likely to fetter the client 's  right of choice .

In the second category ,  general civil cases ,  parties should be able to choose their own lawyers because the interests of justice would be inherently less likely to fetter the client 's  right of choice .  Lord Donaldson implied ,  however ,  that solicitors who exercised their new rights of audience in these cases ought to be expected to concentrate on advocacy .	None
2123	interest	2	They will have to be approved by the Lord Chancellor and be subject to the concurrence of four senior Supreme Court judges ,  of whom Lord Donaldson will be one .  In practice ,  initial drafts of rules will be the subject of ongoing discussions between all four parties .  The four will have to have regard to the	interest	of justice objective . But on the other hand ,  the statute will also include a clear intention that extended rights of audience are put into practical effect as soon as the necessary conditions have been met .  A majority of judges said in their response to the Green Papers that standards of conduct and competence might decline if lawyers who worked in partnerships and took instructions directly from clients  ( most solicitors )  were allowed widespread access to the higher courts .	None
2124	interest	2	Alternative dividing lines which have been informally mooted ,  such as simply restricting solicitor - advocates in Crown Court jury trials to the less serious cases ,  had been viewed as difficult to support as a matter of principle .  Lord Donaldson 's  remarks were greeted with cautious enthusiasm by Bar leaders .  Desmond Fennell , QC , the Bar 's chairman , said that he was greatly encouraged by Lord Donaldson 's indication that the	interests	of justice objective would prevail . Roger Henderson ,  QC ,  the Bar 's  public affairs spokesman ,  warned that the words used in the White Paper were open to different interpretations ,  but said :  Lord Donaldson has plainly interpreted the White Paper on the basis that there has been a major change from the Green Paper .  John Hayes ,  secretary general of the Law Society ,  said he regarded the entire matter as up for debate .	None

There would be Skills UK  a locally structured training commission  a Fair Wages Commission ,  a Health Technology Commission ,  a Health Quality Commission ,  an Education Standards Council ,  an Independent Sentencing Council ,  a Children 's  Commissioner ,  an Environmental Protection Executive ,  and a Social Insurance Fund administered by an independent commission .

2127	interest	6	The fabrics side was held back by a decline in demand for batiks in West Africa .  Conventional wisdom is that Tootal will add management expertise to Coats ,  but on the evidence of the first half neither is skilled at controlling working capital .  Tootal 's is around 35 per cent higher than the group would like , and an	interest	charge that should be declining was a fifth higher than last year . Pre - tax profits this year will be lower than last year 's  42.3m and the shares ,  which slipped 1.5p to 127p ,  are only being held up by the Coats offer ,  worth 133p .

2128	interest	6	The deal doubles Bull 's  presence in the US and should boost turnover of the Bull group to about 7bn .  Zenith Computer ,  part of Zenith Electronics Corporation ,  is a manufacturer of IBM personal computer clones and is an important player in the market for portable computers .  But Zenith recently announced second quarter losses due to the strong dollar , high	interest	charges , and squeezed margins in the computer sector . The acquisition will pitch Bull into the front line of the competitive PC market and is part of the group 's  overall drive to become a leader in international information technology .  Jerry Pearlman ,  Zenith Electronic 's  chairman ,  said that the net proceeds  about 22m after taxes and expenses  would be used to boost investment in lucrative consumer areas ,  such as high definition television .

2130	interest	7	This is the first visible sign of a shareholders '  revolt against the chairman ,  Sir Derek Alun - Jones ,  since the discovery of a 185m fraud which threatens the group 's  future .  Sir Derek believes he should not be held to blame since the fraud occurred in the accounts of International Signal and Control ,  which had received a clean audit when Ferranti bought the company two years ago. Trustees representing substantial family	interests	have written to Sir Derek asking for the board to be replaced or supplemented by new directors . It is an accepted practice in dire situations such as this that the board is replaced or supplemented by a new board charged with the function of restoring the fortunes of the company and the confidence of customers ,  the letter says .  You may care to consider whether this is not a practice to be followed in the case of Ferranti .	None
2131	interest	7	The statements that have been made by the company have made no reference to board changes ,  the letter said .  The family 's  interests include shares owned by the estate of the late Basil de Ferranti ,  a former chairman of the company .  Sebastian de Ferranti , Basil 's brother and now a director of Ferranti 's competitor GEC , is a trustee of the	interests	but it is not clear whether he shares these views . Basil de Ferranti was chairman of the company until it merged with International Signal and Control ,  a takeover which he supported .  As part of the deal Mr de Ferranti agreed to stand down in favour of Sir Derek and to allow James Guerin ,  International Signal 's  founder ,  to come on to the board as deputy chairman .	None
2132	interest	6	A HIGH - POWERED group of finance directors has urged the Government to consider giving greater commercial freedom to nationalised industries such as British Rail and the Post Office rather than privatising them outright .  They should be made to correspond more closely with private sector practice and allowed the freedom to borrow from the market place ,  the group says .  They should also be given permission to issue some form of fixed	interest	profit - related bond , be allowed to raise a proportion of their equity direct from the public and be subject to independent regulation similar to that of privatised utilities . These are the main recommendations of a report from the Hundred Group of senior British finance directors ,  published yesterday and circulated to ministers and senior civil servants .  At the moment nationalised industries are severely restricted in the way they borrow money .	None
2133	interest	4	There were also a few devout Muslims .  I was told that both the new right and those who support the Government 's  view  that the present blasphemy laws which protect only Christianity should be retained  had been excluded .  Members of both groups either behaved badly at conferences or had no	interest	in improving race relations . Fay Weldon and her allies had not been invited either ,  because ,  it was felt ,  they held racist attitudes ,  consciously or not. The liberal establishment believes that the law should apply equally to all religions .	None
2134	interest	6	The most powerful is that the figures ,  inaccurate as they have turned out to be ,  convinced experts employed by big investors and banks such as National Westminster .  Moreover ,  it is notoriously difficult to predict the costs of major infrastructural projects ,  almost all of which run wildly over budget .  In this case , the construction timetable proved wrong , as did very optimistic forecasts concerning the rates of inflation and	interest	. Even so ,  the quality of project management is surely open to examination .  It is not as if Eurotunnel was working at the leading - edge of technological innovation .	None
2135	interest	2	They accepted an objectionable ,  racially - discriminatory basis on which Hong Kong citizenship would be decided .  They accepted limitations on the jurisdiction of Hong Kong 's  post - 1997 Supreme Court ,  and proposals which would diminish the independence of judges .  They refrained from responding to a long series of statements by senior Chinese officials which contradicted both the letter and the spirit of the Joint Declaration - including an assurance , for example , that the post - 1997 Hong Kong press would be free for as long as it did not publish anything detrimental to China 's national	interest	. London was all too obviously selling Hong Kong down the Pearl River ,  despite its protestations to the contrary .  Even now ,  and though the events of June triggered a brief period of reappraisal ,  the British still seem besotted by their vision of China as a billion - strong market for their goods and services  and either unaware ,  or unimpressed ,  that their exports to Hong Kong itself are currently worth three times as much as those to its northern neighbour .

2136	interest	2	We are strong now on women 's  rights ,  the environment and disarmament .  This sort of language dismays the traditional ranks of SPD supporters ,  especially the big trade unions ,  who fear their voice within the party is being muffled .  It has not always been easy for those working class voters who see the Greens as an undisciplined bunch , inimical to the	interests	of industrial society , to keep up with the SPD 's enthusiastic appetite for environmental matters . There has been a noticeable shift of working class support from the SPD to the far - right Republicans  not as much as the losses from the Christian Democrats ,  but enough to worry party managers .

The differences in our electorate are much bigger than for the conservative parties ,  says Heidi Wieczorek - Zeul ,  a member of the party praesidium .  Tactically to combine the	interests	of a miner and an environmentalist just does not work . It can only be done with conviction ,  with the sort of approach we used in 1969 with Ostpolitik .  Today ,  ecological and women 's  issues are the equivalent of Ostpolitik for us .	None
2138	interest	2	The party leader ,  Hans - Jochen Vogel ,  a rather uninspiring figure ,  has nonetheless proved adept at managing this delicate evolution which ,  bolder than anything the Labour party ever contemplated ,  has avoided the sort of fratricidal bloodletting which ravaged its British counterpart .  The traditionalist camp has had to swallow some bitter pills .  Oskar Lafontaine , the SPD leader in the Saarland , has argued vociferously that a modern mass party like the SPD could not afford to have its policies confined to the narrow	interests	of employed industrial workers . In the party 's  new programme ,  the trade unions have had to backtrack on their central demand ,  now accepting that a shorter working week will mean reduced wages .  But Mr Lafontaine ,  standard - bearer of the up - and - coming generation ,  and the second most important figure after Mr Vogel on the committee drafting the party programme for the next decade ,  has certainly not had things all his own way .

2139	interest	7	The white - bearded campaigner prided himself on blunt ,  outspoken views .  Despite his lack of political experience ,  Clouthier 's  20 - year leadership of business organisations stood him in good stead .  After the banks ' nationalisation he sold most of his	interests	in the dozen or so companies he had created and drawn his wealth from , and committed himself to combating the existing political system . He quickly established himself within the PAN ,  challenging its professional politicians with the support of his business colleagues and unifying the fractious party .  He took conservative ideas on privatisation and land reform ,  gave them a populist anti - government bent and managed to woo over many poorer voters  -  especially in northern Mexico  who previously feared that the PAN represented only business interests .

2140	interest	4	Very much to the benefit of the college ,  Hargreaves had the personality and the authority of experience needed to implement the legal requirements in the academic workplace without causing rancour or resentment .  Hargreaves continued the Sheffield pattern by mounting exhibitions by young artists in Imperial 's  Consort Gallery ,  quality shows that soon attracted a following and that for years formed a regular feature of the London art scene .  His advocacy aroused the	interests	of some of his many friends in the gallery world , bringing several artists to wider notice . Hargreaves was a rich amalgam of natural gifts and sensibilities .  His lively and passionate nature ,  disciplined by a formal scientific training ,  was expressed creatively in his own paintings ,  his intense love of music ,  and in his relationships ,  personal and professional .

2141	interest	4	Developers '  ancestors include such admired figures as John Nash ,  the Adams brothers together with the builders of Bath ,  Bloomsbury and the New Town in Edinburgh .  The London we have now is predominantly the work of developers .  Such people are not all motivated simply by money , but by an	interest	in building and in architecture and , like everyone else , they have to live with their creations . In theory ,  market forces ought to ensure that the consumer rejects inferior products and makes them unsellable .  Of course ,  distance lends enchantment to the work of developers of the past .	None
2142	interest	2	Commercial pressures are hostile to the creation of space ,  except in the most limited and functional sense ,  either inside or out .  The ideal interior is neutral and unobstructed ,  while the demand for floor area pushes buildings to the limits of their sites ,  making public spaces ,  or any but the thinnest facades ,  unprofitable .  As the creation of space is the primary concern , it is not surprising the	interests	of developers and of the well - being of cities are so often in conflict . The struggle between commercial pressure and good architecture is an unequal one ,  on which many developers are not prepared to expend much energy .  They value their architects more for their business demeanours than for their designs ,  and choose them from a limited number of established companies ,  more valued for reliability than originality .

2146	interest	6	Even during the recorded period ,  however ,  there are persuasive reasons for believing that the actual quantity of reserves used for intervention was at least 650m - 700m .  Sales of reserves were offset by an inflow of 260m of foreign currency receipts from the final instalment of the sale of British Steel shares .  And the net change is reduced by	interest	on the 42.88bn of outstanding reserves probably worth between 250m and 300m a month . Then there is the tricky question of forward market operations .

Mr Stuart 's  place will in turn be taken by Peter Jansen ,  deputy chairman and group chief executive of Caradon .	None
2148	interest	7	The Caradon management team is joining MB Group and bringing their company with them .  Dr Smith explained that MB Group ,  formerly Metal Box ,  had identified Caradon 18 months ago as a suitable means of expanding into building products but the company had had to reorganise itself and create a new management team to make the current deal possible .  Earlier this year MB Group merged its world - wide packaging	interests	with the French Carnaud to form CMB in which it has a 25.5 per cent stake . This meant it could concentrate on two core businesses  security printing and heating and bathroom products .  Caradon was bought from publishers Reed International for 61m in 1985 and came to the stock market in June 1987 with an initial market value of 134m .	None
2149	interest	2	Whatever form it takes ,  it offers no personal recognition or status ,  and nor should it .  It is necessary ,  however ,  that society recognises the importance of caring for others as a fundamental part of living .  No one would deny that enterprise and competitiveness are important ; but what we see around us today is the elevation of self -	interest	as something to be applauded . If we are brought up to accept the doctrine of looking after number one ,  it is not surprising to find the result of that upbringing reflected in society .  This inevitably leads to a climate in which the likelihood of giving not only money but also one 's  time is reduced .	None
2150	interest	2	It is shrewd of Mr Kinnock to attempt to enlist this mood and to link Labour with such concepts as patriotism ,  efficiency and plain common sense ,  virtues which have more often been associated with the Conservative Party. Similarly ,  it is shrewd of him to play for the internationalist vote after a prolonged period of sullen Little Englandism during which Labour threatened to withdraw from the Common Market and called into question this country 's  role within Nato .  Increasingly the Prime Minister is regarded by many swing voters as unconstructive and isolationist rather than a determined defender of British	interests	. She ,  and not Mr Kinnock ,  is constantly at odds with the European Community and the Commonwealth .  A stance which was appropriate for the Age of Brezhnev and Galtieri now seems out of date and out of touch with the spirit of the times .	None
2151	interest	6	There is no question here of the swing of the pendulum .  It is rather comforting in a way .  Chesterton said that tradition is the democracy of the dead but in France the dead get a seat in parliament , together with three secretaries each ,	interest	- free loans , subsidised foreign travel and an income of about 40,000 , half of which is tax free . Those who attack the Senate say that it should be abolished ,  that it is useless and corrupt .

His many enthusiasms extended to owning a couple of elderly Rolls - Royces ,  attempting to restart a School of Architecture at the RA ,  submitting with success his own drawings to the Summer Exhibition and vigorously supporting home - town local causes ,  including the Malvern Arts Club .  He had a passionate	interest	in music and opera which led him to design several operatic sets . In appearance tall ,  bald and gangling ,  eyes alight with pleasure ,  tufts of hair in disarray ,  he was the personification of a slightly mad professor .

2153	interest	4	DAVID KING ,  King of the Castle ,  was one of the great authorities on the medieval castle and author of a definitive catalogue of all castles built in England and Wales .  Born in 1913 ,  he was educated at Clifton College and went on to read law at Bristol University .  His service in the Royal Artillery in the Second World War took him to the Middle East , and there he was able to develop his	interest	in military architecture through the study of the citadel at Damascus , and the siege of the crusader castle of Krak des Chevaliers . The results were eventually published after the war .  King lost a leg during war service in Italy ,  an event which makes his thorough surveys of castles ,  notably those in Wales ,  even more remarkable .	None
2154	interest	2	For many readers ,  Le Monde 's  view of the world is France 's  view of the world .  That view is presented in a classical French ,  rarely illustrated ,  and then only with the smallest photographs or the occasional line drawing .  It follows an editorial policy that believes foreign news should lead the first three pages , that matters of national	interest	should be philosophically debated in the newspaper 's columns , and that half a page of sport either side of the weekend is enough . Having survived a financial crisis in the early 1980s ,  thanks to support from the banks and from a staff prepared to agree to a voluntary wage freeze ,  the paper is now making money and putting on readers ,  so why has the management now decided to modernise the title   On first sight it might seem a case of plus ca change ,  plus c'est la meme chose .

The needs of a rural ,  11 to 18 school are very different from an inner - city upper school .

You often find the civil court has dealt with the abuse and the perpetrator in the context of what is in the best interests of the child .  But she added that prosecution and imprisonment by a criminal court did not serve the	interests	of the family as a whole , or of the child who remained part of it , or how victims would deal with contact with the abuser after release . Ms Willbourne also called for the civil courts to be given new powers to exclude an abuser from the home instead of the child .  The Ukrainain State Dancers start nationwide tour	None
2159	interest	4	In a decision which was widely predicted ,  Mr Patten has declared himself minded to uphold the view of the department 's  inspectorate that Consortium Developments ,  representing several of the country 's  major home - builders ,  had not made a sufficiently strong case for the development of 4,800 houses in what is an abandoned quarry and a conifer plantation .  Explaining a new policy drift which will respect local political will at the expense of new development ,  Mr Patten said :  Over the next 10 or 12 years we are going to need substantial numbers of new houses .  At the same time we can expect people 's	interest	in green issues and concern for their local environment to grow . The decision is part of a much wider shift in government thinking ,  in which Mr Patten has clearly been given Cabinet permission to distance his own policy from that of predecessors ,  such as Michael Heseltine ,  and ,  to a lesser extent ,  Mr Ridley ,  now Trade and Industry Secretary ,  who believed that economic success depended on getting the planner off the backs of business and citizen alike .  Mr Patten yesterday issued a draft housing planning policy guidance note ,  which will update previous documents .	None

The debt goes deeper than money .  Television , both BBC 's coverage for 20 years and ITV 's for the past five , not only attracted lucrative sponsorships but developed a greater	interest	among the young .

2161	interest	4	This is pretty low for a speculative investment and assumes the company is capitalised at 12.5 times earnings in the year to 31 March 2017 .  A combination of a six month construction over - run and attendance of only 10 million cuts the return to 12 per cent .  Eurodisney and its advisers , SG Warburg , can feel confident that the issue will go well because of the	interest	already shown in France , where half the 607m of shares will be issued . They have fired this interest by spending 44m on the issue ,  aiming it primarily at the retail investor when one might expect an issue of this sort to be more suitable for institutions .  As with a privatisation ,  small investors may be tempted by short term profits and ,  like Eurotunnel ,  the issue is a hostage to many variables .	None
2162	interest	6	We would be happy to do more ventures involving cross - shareholdings ,  especially in Europe .  The half year result was a 34 per cent rise over last time ,  and at the higher end of City estimates .  The	interest	charge , at 35m against 24m , was lower than many had expected . Mr Tennant explained that this was partly because payments for the LVMH shares had been delayed ,  but added :  We are not really exposed to UK interest rates .  Most of our debt is in the form of US dollars or French francs ,  where rates are a good deal lower .	None
2163	interest	7	Stockholders account for 60 per cent of the 20 million tonnes of steel sold in the UK each year .  British Steel already held 15 per cent of the stockholder market through its own service centres operation .  Walker , which bought out GKN 's steel stockholding	interests	two years ago , has a market share of 20 per cent . Sir Robert said British Steel would now rest content at the combined figure of 35 per cent .

2164	interest	6	Many building societies have pared this down yet further by offering loss - leader discounts on standard loan rates to attract new business .  Roughly half the leading building societies '  borrowers repay on budget schemes .  They will pay nothing more now , but will have the delayed	interest	on at least two mortgage rate rises to account for when the new yearly rates are fixed early in 1990 .

2170	judgment	5	The period between 1939 to 1949 has been called the most productive and significant period in Canadian letters to date ,  which matches the 10 Lost Years of the post - Depression period exactly .  Leonard was fortunate to come to it when he did ,  for he was able to enter into the fruits and the confidence born of it ,  as well as classical English literature .  If , under Hugh MacLennan , he was able to form his	judgment	and turn his phrases under the eye of a skilful novelist , in Louis Dudek 's adroit hands he was able to fashion and test his poetic acumen to the full ; both were to be of absorbing interest to him. Moreover ,  Dudek 's  scholarship was of a more penetrating kind than anything under which Leonard had yet sat ,  or was to sit ,  as became that of a Doctor of Letters from Columbia University .  He was a highly reputable and incisive critic of art and culture as well as literature ;  a bilinguist of note ,  and  more important than all those !   a poet of rare accomplishment ;  a poet 's  poet .

The rabbis had a saying :  Where there is too much ,  there is something missing .  The excess to which some have pointed may well disclose the absence of something crucial , but for that we must defer	judgment	. In the meantime we may note that ,  right or wrong ,  balanced or not ,  Leonard spoke from the heart  as did the prophets of old ;  the sell - out qualities of the book demonstrated the need ,  as well as his astuteness in compiling his selection .

2173	judgment	3	LORD JUSTICE BALCOMBE said that the point of substance in the case was whether the mother 's  consent was unreasonably withheld .  The leading authority was the House of Lords case of Re W  ( 1971 )  AC 682 where it was held that when dealing with the question of withholding consent ,  the test was reasonableness ,  not culpability or indifference ,  and although the child 's  welfare per se was not the test ,  it was relevant .  Lord Hailsham of St Marylebone , LC , said that the question was whether a parental veto came within the band of possible reasonable decisions and not whether it was right or mistaken and that there was a band of decisions within which the court should seek to replace the individual 's	judgment	with his own . Those tests presented the court with a difficulty .  It was very difficult for a court to say what a reasonable mother would have done in circumstances which were almost hypothetical .	None

The appellant appealed on the ground that the co - defendant 's  plea of guilty should have been excluded by the trial judge in the exercise of his discretion under section 78 ( 1 )  of the 1984 Act .  Mrs Nutt submitted that it would be difficult ,  if not impossible ,  for the appellant to try and set about to prove that the co - defendant had not committed an act of gross indecency with him ,  that he was in effect deprived of any opportunity of cross - examining or otherwise challenging the co - defendant and that to admit the evidence would be simply to render the proceedings against the appellant wholly unfair .

Paragraph 5 referred simply to enforcement of a	judgment	or order against a person who , under the rule , was bound by it . It did not purport to enlarge the class of persons who might enforce the judgment or order and there was no basis for attributing any such intention or effect .

2184	judgment	0	The Declaration was  not surprisingly  unaccompanied by any mechanism for the enforcement of the rights which it declared .  In that respect it differed from the European Convention of Human Rights ,  to which the United Kingdom adhered in November 1950 under the auspices of the Council of Europe and which came into force in September 1953 .  The Convention established a European Court of Human Rights , to which the signatory states accorded supranational powers , and before which at this moment Britain awaits	judgment	in respect of acts committed in Northern Ireland in 1971 . Significantly ,  there is no provision  ( yet )  in the European Convention corresponding to Article 25 of the UN Declaration .

2185	judgment	0	And now we have come up before the beak for a second wigging ,  because on the application of  one of our own citizens we are accused of degrading treatment or punishment inflicted in the Isle of Man .  It is impossible to exaggerate the revolutionary significance of the recognition of a binding judicial tribunal external to the realm .  There is no similarity between this and international arbitration , where a state voluntarily agrees in a particular case to accept the	judgment	of a tribunal , as two individuals might freely agree to accept the adjudication of an arbitrator . International arbitration is no more a transfer of sovereignty than private arbitration is an ousting of the jurisdiction of the courts .  The European Convention is different in kind ,  and the British signatories of it ,  worthy predecessors to the signatories of the Treaty of Brussels in 1972 ,  put an end to a period of more than four centuries during which no causes have been carried out of this realm .

2186	judgment	0	The consequences strike at the right of the people of this country to live under the laws made and altered by their representatives in Parliament .

In order to arrive at its findings , the European Commission does what no court in this country can do , namely sit in	judgment	upon the policy and justification of an Act of Parliament . What is more ,  and equally incompatible with our conception of parliamentary democracy ,  the judicial interpretation of the terms of such a document as the Convention is not susceptible to statutory control or modification .  In the system to which the European Convention belongs ,  the judiciary are the legislators ,  and their powers as such are the more sweeping because of the necessarily vague and general terms in which the socalled human rights are defined .

2190	judgment	0	ADECISION on whether a trainee journalist should be jailed for contempt of court was yesterday adjourned until next month pending a hearing in the House of Lords .  Mr Justice Hoffman said in the High Court that he had decided to suspend judgment until he knew how soon the House of Lords was likely to hear an appeal against an order forcing Mr William Goodwin ,  aged 23 ,  who works on the Engineer magazine ,  to reveal confidential information .  After being assured by Mr Geoffrey Robertson , QC , defending , that the appeal process would be dealt with this week , he said he had decided to suspend	judgment	until January 15 . Earlier yesterday ,  the Court of Appeal refused an application by Mr Goodwin 's  employers ,  the publishers Morgan Grampian ,  to revoke the order forcing him to hand over notes containing confidential financial information concerning a company ,  which cannot be named for legal reasons .  The company alleges that the information came from a stolen document ,  and wants to take action against the source .	None

2204	judgment	5	There are powerful arguments in favour of saying that there are other killings where an intent to kill cannot be established ,  and yet where the moral or social culpability is equal to that in most intentional killings .  Of course ,  one cannot be adamant about whether they merit the label murder ,  because that is a question of drawing the line between murder and manslaughter ,  which is not susceptible of any precise resolution .

2208	judgment	0	At the Essex Forest Eyre of 1277 it was presented that Alexander Not of Havering had entered the Abbess of Barking 's  wood and felled an oak .  He had been discovered by the abbess 's  steward ,  Richard of Bernstead ,  who ,  when he resisted attachment ,  seized and bound him ,  took him to Barking ,  imprisoned him for three days and afterwards delivered him to the forester and the verderer .  The	judgment	of the court was that because Richard was not a sworn forester , he was liable to amercement . In the execution of their duties the foresters often had to contend with armed bands of desperate men ;  in many cases they were beaten and even killed while attempting to arrest Forest offenders .  In 1351 Edward III granted John the woodward of Raskelf a pension of 3d .  a day for good service and especially because his eyes were torn out and his tongue and his fingers cut off by malefactors in the Forest of Galtres in the time when he was one of the King 's  foresters there .

Verderers and agisters were on occasion ,  however ,  appointed directly by the king or by the Justice of the Forest ;  at other times the warden of the forest was ordered to see that vacancies were filled .  During the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries the verderers ,  regarders and agisters usually held office for life ,  provided that they discharged their duties faithfully and well ,  but in the fifteenth century the authority of the verderer ,  like that of the coroner ,  was brought to an end by the death of the king ,  and the sheriffs were ordered to hold new elections .

At the Huntingdonshire Forest Eyre of 1255 the foresters and verderers presented a clerk and his page for a trespass against the venison .  The	judgment	of the court was that because the verderers and the Steward of the Forest made no mention in their rolls of the name of the said page ,  nor of his delivery ,  nor of his escape ,  and the business of the King so far as it relates to the said boy is entirely undone ,  therefore they are in mercy .

2211	judgment	1	The local gentry and others were presented for taking the deer ,  which they had probably been accustomed to do for generations with little interference .  Other presentments concerned the unwarranted felling of trees and cutting of branches in the forest coppices ,  and the overburdening of the forest pastures with unauthorized numbers of cattle ,  sheep and pigs .  To give	judgment	upon these presentments , the ancient machinery of the Forest Eyre was once more set in motion after a long period of general disuse . Between 1488 and 1490 eyres were held in the Berkshire and Surrey divisions of Windsor Forest ,  in Hampshire ,  Wiltshire ,  Northamptonshire ,  Essex ,  Buckinghamshire and Huntingdonshire .  The court rolls show that the Forest law had been generally disregarded ,  and that the king 's  deer had been hunted and the forest timber felled on a large scale .	None
2212	judgment	1	Interest rates would have to be higher and there is a risk that a Labour government facing difficult choices would be tempted to devalue sterling ,  as feared by financial markets .  Despite Labour 's  plans to raise taxes by 6.8 billion in a full year ,  the analysis says it would be unable to fund its election spending promises beyond initial moves to raise pensions and child benefit and a modest recovery programme .  The report makes no	judgment	on Labour 's tax plans . However ,  it argues that VAT increases will be required whichever party is in power if public borrowing is to be reduced .  Implicit in this analysis is the view that Labour would have little scope for raising additional revenue by further increases in income tax directed at the better - off .	None
2213	judgment	6	It was the greatest struggle despite all these economy measures to scrape together the VAT payable by July 31 ,  said the judgment .  The result was there was very little money left in the kitty to meet the bill but even so the payment was just two weeks late .  I have no doubt that it was this misfortune that caused the appellant 's financial difficulties , one huge bad debt and the loss of regular valuable business , said the	judgment	. Mr Anderson told the tribunal he could not apply for bad debt relief until 12 months after the debt had arisen while Customs had penalised him for paying the VAT a mere 16 days late .  He says :  I feel I have established a precedent for arguing that if there is a genuine reason why one has n't got the cash to pay the tax the surcharge should be waived .	None

2216	judgment	3	The scandal is that a supine and cowardly press has allowed itself to be intimidated into censoring the truth even though it distorts our entire view of reality .  The question ,  Does it matter   answers itself .  Of course it matters if people are deliberately robbed of the means of	judgment	by suppression of facts which , in any other situation , would be regarded as necessary to make sense of what had taken place . Only one of the many newspapers I read mentioned the fact that the assailant was black and it was with the most extreme difficulty that I was able to ascertain from reporters and policemen ,  who all refused to be named ,  that the callous passers - by were also black .  But it is very important ;  it changes the whole picture .	None
2217	judgment	5	Personally ,  however ,  Diderot seems to have been genial and agreeable .  He quarrelled with Rousseau after being on intimate terms with him ,  but then everybody did .  He was jealous of Voltaire 's renown , but his	judgment	of him , not entirely favourable , was sound enough . He made ,  like many intellectuals ,  rather a fool of himself when flattered by people in power  in his case ,  Catherine .  All the same ,  despite his intelligence and charm ,  Diderot is perhaps less interesting in himself than as a symptom and influence .	None
2218	judgment	5	A measure of the difference between Mr Major 's  personal standing and Mrs Thatcher 's  is that ,  whereas a mere 19 per cent of voters on Friday and Saturday said they thought Mr Major would make the worst Prime Minister ,  nearly double that proportion ,  34 per cent ,  thought the same of Mrs Thatcher five years ago. Voters clearly have no difficulty distinguishing between real politics and the American show - biz variety .  They are prepared to rate the parties ' campaigns in the style of drama critics reviewing theatrical performances , at the same time forming separate	judgments	about the parties ' and leaders ' ability to govern . Asked to say who had campaigned most impressively ,  32 per cent named Mr Ashdown and the Liberal Democrats ,  27 per cent Mr Kinnock and the Labour party and only 23 per cent Mr Major and the Conservatives .  Their voting preferences were ,  of course ,  in the reverse order .	None
2219	judgment	5	It was a brutal and cowardly attack on wretched creatures whose offences placed them at the bottom of the prison heap ,  he said .  He told Taylor ,  who appeared in the dock wearing a dark suit with a small teddy bear mascot on the breast pocket ,  that Parliament had laid down a maximum sentence of 10 years for an appropriate case and to deter those who took the law into their own hands .  In my	judgment	this is an appropriate case . I cannot imagine a worse ,  he said .  The worst riot in British penal history started during a Sunday morning service in the Strangeways chapel .	None
2220	judgment	3	Emma Brodie died in Frenchgate shopping centre in Doncaster after being stabbed through the heart with a carving knife by Carol Barratt ,  24 ,  who had attacked another child in the same place weeks earlier .  Trent Regional Health Authority ordered an inquiry into why Dr Neil Silvester ,  a consultant psychiatrist at Doncaster Royal Infirmary ,  had authorised Barratt 's  early release .  It concluded that Dr Silvester had been guilty of a serious error of professional	judgment	and ordered him to take a six - month retraining course . Doncaster Health Authority confirmed yesterday that it had made an undisclosed payment to Mr Rod Brodie and his wife ,  Valerie ,  both 38 .  It said :  The health authority does not accept legal liability but ,  in view of the unique and tragic circumstances of this case ,  has agreed to make a contribution to the family of an undisclosed sum .

2221	judgment	1	Finally ,  he was publicly warned and barred from communion ,  and the people advised to have nothing to do with him. This was in order to convince him of his misery and the necessity of true repentance and reformation .  After this he would rail and curse at Richard Baxter 's door and would prophesy	judgments	against Kidderminster in the market place . One time he tried to murder Richard Baxter in the churchyard .  However ,  when he grabbed Richard Baxter 's  cloak it came away ,  and before he could do any more harm a couple of by - standers restrained him and hauled him off to the magistrates .	None
2222	judgment	0	Put another way ,  it is discipline ,  not punishment ,  which constitutes the connecting thread running through the diverse range of probation practice .  This point was made by one commentator during the first review of the Probation System at the beginning of this century :  his comments remain pertinent for the Home Office in their current review at the end of the century .  Probation is a test or trial of the character of a convicted offender under suspension of	judgment	, in order that the court may determine if the probationer be fit to retain his or her place as a helpful member of society , or being unfit , must be deprived of his or her liberty as a menace to society . It is established for the purpose of correction and oversight .  It is a conditional freedom .	None
2223	judgment	1	Nor ,  it seemed ,  did they even suspect the existence of Station X. After all ,  Bletchley was an important railway junction ,  and the lines gleaming in the moonlight could have been an aid to enemy reconnaissance planes and bombers .  Indeed ,  the R.A.F. was known to use railway tracks as navigational guidelines .  But the location 's convenience for those Oxbridge dons who formed the nucleus of the original community had weighed down the scales against possible danger of discovery ; and this	judgment	was vindicated , because we were never bombed . This was as well ,  for even a single light raid would have reduced the flimsy huts to matchwood .  For our part ,  we appeared to take for granted the Germans '  total ignorance of our presence ,  for we had no air - raid drill ,  nor did we have a single air - raid shelter ,  slit - trench ,  sandbag blast - wall ,  nor even so much as a steel helmet  only a large poster which read :	None
2224	judgment	1	He poured out his heart to me .  Instead of rejoicing at his release and the prospect of going home ,  in his unbalanced mental state ,  he spoke of staying in Britain  with me !  I quickly talked him out of that , telling him that he must find out the truth before passing	judgment	, and reminding him that he had had a good marriage . Later ,  from South Africa ,  he wrote to thank me for this advice ,  but now he reciprocated by telling me ,  with great gentleness ,  that I should not go on hoping ,  as he himself had searched the P.O.W .  lists ,  and Leslie 's  name was not on any of them .  Three months later ,  in October 1945 ,  sixteen months from the night when Leslie 's  plane took off ,  came the cold official presumption of death :	None
2225	judgment	5	He had expressed so often the depth of his love and had made it clear to me that I had given meaning to his life .  He would not have presumed to tell me how to conduct the remainder of mine .  One of my friends said he was a romantic boy who thought he bore a charmed life , but I argued that this was a superficial	judgment	. Romantic he certainly was ,  but I feel there was a deeper layer of consciousness from which he had decided to take a calculated risk ,  fully believing he would survive .  No one was more eager for life ,  and none better equipped to live it fully .	None
2226	judgment	1	The greater plantain  (  Plantago major  )  is known as  Saint Patrick 's  bowl .  Hemlock  (  Conium maculatum  )  has the Gaelic name of  ,  which it is suggested by Cameron ,  is possibly from the word for feathers ,   .  Although there are also other Gaelic names for hemlock , the Biblical reference in Hosea X. 4 uses this name : ( Thus	judgment	springeth up like a hemlock in the furrows of the field ) . Hemlock water - dropwort  (  Oenanthe crocata  )  ,  however ,  has a Gaelic name that suggests another kind of imagery :   bog ,  meaning gentle deceit .  It was said to have been given to prisoners as poison from the time of Pliny ,  and most references agree that it was also the plant with which Socrates was poisoned .	None
2227	judgment	1	Many Christians started to worry that Christian faith was being made to rest upon the merely provisional conclusions of historians .  Theologians pointed to what was dubbed the ugly broad  ditch of A D. Lessing ,  namely that accidental truths of history cannot be the basis of necessary truths of reason .  The beliefs of Christians could not , it was said , rest upon historical	judgments	, because these beliefs as truths of reason would then depend upon the truths of history , which were only accidental ( in other words , they might not be the case ) . A conclusion is only as strong as its premises .  If the premises might not be true ,  then the conclusion also might not be true .	None
2228	judgment	5	But Dillon LJ said :   if the LEA does not itself decide the special educational provision that should be made for the child ,  but leaves that to be decided by the school ,  with remedial classes and other facilities as may be available in the school ,  the LEA is not itself determining the special educational provision for the child within the meaning in section 7 ( 1 )  ;  consequently ,  the LEA is not obliged to make and maintain a statement .  A decision to leave what is to be done for a particular child to the school is not itself , in my	judgment	, a determination of the special educational provision for the child which would necessitate the making of a statement . The Lashford  case thus demonstrates the extent of LEA discretion under the 1981 Act .  Hannon 's  prognosis of the Act ,  that LEAs will be able to draw the line between the statemented and the unstatemented where they please ,  would appear to have been accurate .	None
2229	judgment	2	What freedom teachers may have in this area centres principally on their delivery of the National Curriculum .  In this regard reference may within the programmes of study teachers will be free to determine the detail of what should be taught ,  although it urged teachers to prepare schemes of work to ensure consistency within a school .  There will be full scope for professional	judgment	, both in relation to teaching and organisation of the curriculum ; and there will be sufficient flexibility in the choice of content to adapt what they teach to the needs of the individual pupil . It would appear that all teachers will be placed in a similar position to that of teachers preparing pupils for external examinations ,  in that they will have set objectives ,  or learning outcomes ,  to be achieved ,  but will be free to plan their lessons as they think fit  especially where the core subjects are concerned .  Some of the other foundation subjects ,  such as art or PE ,  will have far less detailed ATs and PS .	None

Immediately he looked away and stared instead at J. J. Gerrard ,  not caring whether or not he showed his dislike for the situation he was in .

AI is concerned that the Tunisian Government ,  by its failure to investigate allegations of torture brought to its notice ,  appears to be condoning the use of torture .

In the 1961 Observer article that launched Amnesty , Benenson listed the aims of the	organization	. They included :  to enlarge the Right of Asylum and help political refugees to find work .  Adherence to this stated principle has never faltered ,  but other areas of concern took precedence and it was not until the late 1970s that this area of work was developed .	None

The	organization	urgently appealed to the Saudi king to stop the torture and brought the plight of the victims to international attention . On several occasions ,  however ,  delegates have faced obstruction and harassment in carrying out their research .

I 'd be delighted if governments could prove all our reports wrong ,  if that means that human rights are n't being violated ,  Smart said .  but invariably ,  even when we have needed to correct or update details in our reports ,  the sad fact remains that the overall portrait of horror has been shown to be true and if anything ,  understated .

2244	organization	2	True ,  there was some fragmentation of members on class issues .  The occasional independent unionist and independent Orange - lodge representative in politics were a feature of politics from 1880 to 1972 .  The Northern Ireland Labour Party also was the principal	organization	representing protestant trade unionists . But none of these groupings ever came near to threatening the dominance of Unionist Party organization ,  much less the solidarity of protestant loyalists ,  which always appeared total on the issue of incorporation into a united ,  independent Ireland .  It was only with the Troubles ,  from 1968 ,  that unionists  broke ranks .	None
2245	organization	1	But when it comes down to concrete moral judgements and commitments ,  such abstractions will be found interpreted in opposing ways .  Religion The Roman catholic church retained a unified hierarchical	organization	for the whole of the island with its bishops meeting periodically at Maynooth . In 1927 ,  1929 ,  1956 ,  and 1960 ,  there were plenary synods and councils .  Since then ,  the hierarchy has met more or less three times per year ,  but usually in secret sessions .	None
2246	organization	2	Since then ,  the hierarchy has met more or less three times per year ,  but usually in secret sessions .  In the North ,  the bishops pursued the Irish catholic community 's  interests in what could only be called a spirit of pillarization .  This is the arrangement in Holland whereby various institutions such as media , schools , cultural	organizations	, welfare services , and hospitals are duplicated , and run by the separate catholic and protestant communities . In Holland there is even a third or state sector .  In Ulster a full panoply of institutions emerged from the dual pressure of the church 's  concern for its people ,  and the Northern state 's  discrimination against catholics .	None
2247	organization	2	The clerical and lay leadership also experienced a third pressure ,  that of protecting the faithful from the proselytizing activities of a number of evangelical protestants mainly among the young .  The church obtained a separate school system ,  funded mainly by the Northern  Ireland government ,  similar to the system of catholic schools in Britain .  It also set up its own scouting	organizations	, clubs both sporting and social , with Irish music , Irish dancing , and Irish or Gaelic games . These games were and still are much loathed by the majority within the Northern protestant community .  Priests continued to act as sponsors of the local catholic  nationalist political structure ,  chairing meetings of the party and permitting the political use of the parish hall .	None
2248	organization	2	From its domination by the old ascendancy ,  the Orange order in particular came to embrace protestants from all classes and churches .  In fact ,  in rural areas today ,  the Orange hall has frequently been the only place where protestants of all shades have met to renew their belief and commitment to Ulster protestant loyalism  ( Harris 1972 :  1625 )  .  It is important to note that these	organizations	are internally stratified . Those nearer the top ,  particularly in the Black Preceptory ,  the inner sanctum of the society structure ,  are there because of their moral and religious standing in the local community :  wealthy farmers ,  businessmen ,  good churchmen ,  or at least of known moral probity .  They tend to represent the religious as opposed to the rough end of the protestant spiritual spectrum .	None
2249	organization	2	What socialism there has been among the catholic  nationalist tradition has always tended to be allied to republicanism ,  especially in the period 1913 to 1930  ( Rumpf and Hepburn 1977 :  13 )  .  The trade union movement was a case in point .  The labour movement in Ireland was made up of two	organizations	. One of these was James Larkin 's  Irish Transport and General Workers '  Union ,  the ITGWU .  It came to have Connolly 's  support and was on the way to becoming thoroughly nationalist and republican under Connolly 's  influence .	None
2250	organization	2	Two years previously ,  a campaign to write into the Irish constitution the existing legislation criminalizing abortion had got under way under the name of the Pro - Life Amendment Campaign .  It is difficult to describe this body accurately .  The bulk of its organizers were members of traditional	organizations	of more recent origin devoted to the strengthening of catholic morality . Having acquired a sufficient number of signatures ,  the Campaign submitted their referendum proposal ,  which the government of the day ,  the Fine Gael  Labour coalition under Garret FitzGerald which had come into power that year ,  decided  to submit to the populace .  The Roman catholic bishops supported the wording of the referendum and ,  as the referendum approached ,  said it was legitimate to oppose the amendment even if one was against abortion ,  which was in any case still immoral and was the direct taking of an innocent life  ( Irish Bishops '  Conference statement ,  quoted O'Carroll 1983 )  .

The	organization	claimed membership from all parts of the South , and its membership contained education specialists , lawyers , people from the media , and civil servants , at least one of whom knew something of the existing channels of power and communication between church and state in the national school system . Energy was directed mainly to the primary sector ,  where ,  until recently ,  it was impossible to have anything but a church - sponsored school if it was to be funded by the state .  In 1978 ,  on the basis of their professional knowledge of schooling and civil administration ,  the organization succeeded in obtaining the necessary government permission to open in Dalkey a multi - denominational school governed principally by the parents ,  the mode of religious instruction to be determined by them .

Even those who had never heard of him mouthed his words ,  repeating them to others as though they had just thought of them themselves ,  which perhaps they had ,  for there is surely such a thing as a spirit of the times .

2255	organization	2	With hindsight it seems that the prevailing structures of police practice will remain as powerful as ever ,  for at a conference on policing at Bristol University  ( 1988 )  ,  the newly retired Sir Kenneth admitted that police culture had defeated many of his attempts to bring a new ethic to the managerial style during his reign as commissioner of the metropolis .  ANTHROPOLOGY FOR THE POLICE It seems relevant that anthropology be used at this time to contribute to the debate on policing , for since the 1964 Police Act and the preceding Royal Commission which was generated through concern over police practice , the	organization	has held an increasingly central place in the public imagination . Policing issues are never long out of the headlines  ( Chibnall 1977 )  ,  and this media obsession has been transmitted into a  wealth of analyses of policing  which have mostly been carried out by outside observers .  Indeed insider accounts have largely consisted of bland reminiscences in the style of my greatest arrests and cases and it has been left to investigative journalism to redress some unacceptable police activity ,  by calling attention to the limits and abuses of police authority ,  power ,  and accountability .

2256	organization	0	In 1979 ,  James Anderton ,  the Christian moralist chief constable of Greater Manchester ,  described the greatest threat to law and order as stemming from seditionist interested groups who do not have the well - being of this country at heart and who mean to undermine democracy  ( Thompson 1979 :  380 )  .  In the light of such a polemic stand ,  it begs the question whether the revelation of how crime figures are manipulated by the police to sustain institutional beliefs  ( see Chapter 5 )  could be said to undermine democracy or be classified as sedition .  For Anderton vehemently rejects the idea of any internal evaluation which might explore the moralities or philosophies of policing : there is simply no room in the management and	organization	of police operations for vague , academic dissertations ( Police Review ; 90 , 19 November 1982 : 4684 ) . In his 1977 annual report ,  Sir David McNee ,  then commissioner of the Metropolitan Police ,  urged that the libertarian should beware .  In due course ,  his successor ,  Sir Kenneth Newman ,  echoed this anti - intellectual stance ,  when he warned insiders that policemen must remember that they are practitioners ,  not crusaders ;  theirs is to do ,  not to righteously philosophise  ( Police Journal  56 ,  No. 1  ( 1983 )  )  .

2257	organization	3	Such people are radically opposed to the idea of sociologists conducting research on the police and long for a return to a golden age when the proverbial veil of secrecy surrounded police work .  When the research is experiential ,  carried out by an insider ,  the publications can prove emotive and will almost certainly be career - problematic for the author .  Usually policemen know the limits allowed by the	organization	and play safe . Harry Templeton  ( 1980 )  ,  a police officer in North Wales ,  suggested :  when you read in Police Review that an officer has been awarded an M.A. after post - graduate study ,  it will probably be in a safe subject such as business management .

2258	organization	2	all totalitarian institutions  ( in Goffman 's  phrase )  embody their principles in an inexplicit way ,  beyond the grasp of consciousness and exhort the essential by an implicit pedagogy ,  capable of instilling a whole cosmology ,  an ethic ,  a political philosophy through injunctions as insignificant as stand up straight .  It is little wonder then that social research is equated with clap trap in police magazines ,  for they aim to support the beliefs of those who have taken on this unconscious cosmology ,  and for whom as Bourdieu  ( ibid .  )  indicates ,  such challenges would defy the most natural manifestations of submission to the established order and abolish lateral possibilities .  In consequence of this acquired system of generative schemes , an imbued belief is implanted in the institutional mind which verges on the natural , while Huxley 's mutilated man pursuing his insider 's reflexivity seeks out the lateral possibility , and makes gestures against the principles of the	organization	. In doing this the anthropologist at home quickly comes to understand why he must always stand on the margins of structure .  For it is one of the dictums of the discipline of anthropology that it will reveal unwelcome truths :	None

( FN 6/11/87 ,  p. 15 )  Formal control , however , is only one aspect of the labour process in any work	organization	. Constables have a definite view about the style of authority they prefer in officers ,  which is summed up well by the remark that they need to be one of the boys :  that is ,  they should not stand on ceremony and overtly assert their authority .  Some sergeants conform to this ,  others do not ,  but the general resistance from below to the excesses of authority ,  coupled with a relative autonomy in the work place ,  affords the men and women in a section the latitude ,  if they so wish ,  to ease ,  using Cain 's  now familiar term  ( 1973 )  ,  or ,  to use their word ,  bluff .

2260	organization	3	A. Lunacharsky underlined the growing rift between  the educational health of the larger towns and the benighted countryside ,  but to no avail .  As was so often the case in central - local relationships ,  poor distribution was often to blame .  The nation - wide state publishing	organization	, Gosizdat , was responsible for the dissemination of official literature of all kinds , but the flow of materials to the provinces remained very weak even as late as 1923 . Only seven of the fifteen large bookstores in Moscow took the trouble to send anything out to provincial peasant reading - centres .  None of them made a special selection of materials suitable for the peasantry ,  so the few books that were dispatched were often too dry or too expensive .	None
2261	organization	2	The sole reference to the peasantry in these laborious instructions was an order to open all rural reading - rooms in the surrounding volosti on 7 November .  The meaning of the October Revolution was then to be explained to anyone who bothered to turn up. Given the importance of this area of Russia in the Civil War and the Polish campaign , the Party 's care for and vigilance over the army does not come as a surprise ; nor does the considerable military presence in 1922 in civilian	organizations	like the hospital and the automobile workshop . The Party 's  obvious nervousness about railway and other workers and relative neglect of the rural hinterland needs a little more explanation .  As the year went by the economic sops to the peasantry provided by NEP began to have a relaxing effect on this class ,  but industrial unrest throughout Russia continued to rise .	None
2262	organization	2	However ,  there was one big kolkhoz consisting of 150 households only 20 versts from Roslavl ' that was said to be too well satisfied with itself ,  and so did not welcome visits from the town .  The party wished to introduce the shefstvo  system in its relations with the kolkhozy  .  A shef	organization	from the towns such as an individual factory would take on the role of cultural and political mentor to some rural group . Shefstvo wag intended to be a nation - wide movement ,  the concrete expression of the more abstract notion of smychka ,  the theory of town and country alliance as expounded originally by Marx .  The ideal was very far from being a reality in 1922 ,  or indeed throughout NEP .	None
2263	organization	2	The arrogance of Bolshevik - inspired youth towards the patriarchal rural community also transpires from other criticisms directed against younger visitors .  But peasants also complained when what they called doctors came out to inspect their cattle and sanitary arrangements ,  or when two peasants who had murdered their wives had to be handed over to a visiting social court  (  obshchestvennyi sud  )  set up by a shefstvo team .  The party 's myopic concentration on the kind of agricultural	organizations	it wished to nurture for the future is also shown in the frequent reports for 1922 on the fragile co - operative network . These efforts proved to be in vain for the most part .  By the middle of 1924 the Agitprop section of the Smolgubkom  was openly declaring that both shefstvo and smychka were a farce in actuality because they had deteriorated into mass weekend outings to the countryside in search of illicit stills .	None
2264	organization	1	Here ,  as so often when one penetrates to particulars ,  the rigid historiographical divisions  ( War Communism ,  NEP ,  the Five - Year Plan years )  crumble .  In our survey of the financial arrangements of NEP as they applied to the Smolensk guberniia ,  it was noted how they were unstable and poorly defined from the outset ,  leading to economic and social tensions at the lower levels .  Right from its inception NEP carried within itself the germs of its own fatal illness , whether one looks at its fiscal	organization	or the economic persona ( like these Nepmen ) which it soon evoked , or in many cases re - awakened . It is true that high - level Bolshevik theorists in Moscow and Petrograd tended to select ,  filter ,  and interpret evidence from the localities in the light of their prevailing general beliefs ,  so that their conclusions had little foundation in hard evidence .  Yet although Yakovlev was one of their kind ,  his factual findings show little sign of conscious or unconscious censorship or exclusion .	None
2265	organization	2	When the Soviet sent the militia to the colony in order to accuse the inmates of robbing peasants ,  Makarenko sent even it packing .  He showed the same scant respect for other agents of central power .  His opinion of the local Komsomol was no doubt coloured by the fact that his own colony was a kind of rival	organization	, but his view broadly reflects that of Yakovlev on the Nikol 'skaia Komsomol ; Yakovlev was a more disinterested outsider . Makarenko wrote :  The local Young Communists were very weak in both number and quality .  They were far too interested in girls and vodka ,  and they had a rather negative influence on the colonists .	None
2266	organization	2	They were far too interested in girls and vodka ,  and they had a rather negative influence on the colonists .  Soviet historians have subsequently tried to cover over this situation .  They have written that It is well known that the great Soviet pedagogue , A. S. Makarenko , succeeded in forming a genuine Soviet collective of charges only after a Komsomol	organization	was established in his colony . In reality ,  a Komsomol political instructor  ( with a criminal record )  entered the colony in 1925 ,  well after Makarenko had established discipline .  This Komsomol representation apparently played no role in the subsequent administration of the colony .	None
2267	organization	2	Yet we cannot take foreign accounts at their face value either .  Political propaganda on the part of the American Relief Administration ,  by far the longest foreign source of aid ,  warped its judgement at the time ,  and the subsequent polarization of Russian - American relations has not improved the objectivity of later scholarly accounts of the Famine as seen through American eyes .  Even F. Nansen , the esteemed Norwegian co - ordinator of many other foreign relief	organizations	, could on occasion be carried away by his emotions and give a semi - fictional account of conditions in the Volga provinces . Calm assessments were hard to come by in the shadow of a tragedy of such proportions .  A native Russian of genius ,  L. Tolstoy ,  had been blinded by his feelings in the famine of  18912 when he made mildly inaccurate statements about the Tsarist relief administration .	None
2268	organization	2	Due to wartime conditions the peasantry got the same amount of agricultural machinery over the years 191521 that they had been able to buy in a single year prior to the World War .  They had suffered in the Civil War from requisitioning by Red ,  White ,  and Green armies ,  and to some extent from the Bolshevik - inspired kombedy   ( committees of poor peasants )  .  As the Famine grew , poor co - operation between the Soviet authorities and foreign relief groups , and amongst the foreign	organizations	themselves , exacerbated the situation . The worst aspects  of co - ordination ,  however ,  were central - local relations within the Soviet hierarchy .  We will return to this later ,  but at this point the course of the Famine needs to be related very briefly .	None
2269	organization	2	Conditions in the guberniia capitals were dire ,  but they were even worse in the rural hinterland .  It was still possible in early 1922 to buy foodstuffs in the city markets if one had the money .  Soviet and foreign relief	organizations	had installed themselves with efficiency and were giving out free food . The villages on the other hand were quite desolate .  Up to half of the houses were boarded up in areas that were starving .	None
2270	organization	2	At this point we can embark on an investigation of the spatial or horizontal effects of the Famine in 1922 .  Internal movement within the worst - affected areas should be looked at first .  Those peasants who continued to own draught animals had lent them to relief	organizations	at the height of the Famine , but by the spring of 1922 they refused to do this any longer , since they now found many profitable uses for them . Owners of draught animals had a virtual monopoly oh the transport of grain to the miller ,  the market ,  and the local collection - point for the tax in kind .  If the tax was paid promptly ,  a discount was given .	None
2271	organization	2	In other ways positive help could be given by more fortunate regions .  Indeed M. I. Kalinin ,  the nominal head of famine relief ,  claimed that 70 to 80 per cent of the adult population of Russia was active on the hunger front .  Party , Soviet , co - operative , military , educational , and trade - union	organizations	were involved . The latter designated special weeks for the production or collection of goods to be contributed to the aid programme .  By February 1922 trade - union lotteries were being held in forty - eight gubernii .	None
2272	organization	2	Poor control over shipments led to theft and other misdemeanours .  Despite internal and foreign suggestions as to how to improve horizontal co - operation ,  the central authorities took no action throughout 1922 .   At both guberniia and central levels the Soviet government established a liaison system between their own plenipotentiaries and all foreign relief	organizations	. It was headed by Alexander Eiduk ,  a pugnacious character who was a member of the GPU collegium .  Foreign organizers soon discovered that the system seemed to be modelled on Trotsky 's  military commissars .	None
2273	organization	2	Certainly suspect committee members had attempted to go abroad ,  but the real reason was probably that the committee had served its purpose by acting as a bait to attract foreign relief organizations  ( the ARA drew up an agreement on 20 August )  .  Alternatively the committee could have served as a scapegoat if Pomgol activities had failed completely .  Since all foreign relief	organizations	dealt with Pomgol and with Eiduk as chief plenipotentiary , subsequent non - Russian scholars have tended to over - concentrate on the workings of Pomgol and its guberniia equivalents . Yet Pomgol was little more than a conglomerate made up of other relevant state departments .  The Commissariat of Agriculture was the key element within Pomgol .	None
2274	organization	2	Gosplan and other central economic organs from 1921 on had accumulated on paper a number of plans for reconstruction which they were now eager to realize .  As in the recent past ,  and as was to be the case with much greater frequency after the start of the Five - Year Plans ,  planners in Moscow drew up neat and rather abstract formulations that did not match up closely with local realities and timings .  Foreign relief	organizations	and subsequent students of their work have tended to exaggerate this dichotomy with regard to the Famine , but internal Soviet sources lend credence to the view that the sudden withdrawal of many kinds of domestic relief was premature . In 1922 it was not so easy to predict crop yields as it is today .  In that sense the shift in policy contained an element of chance .	None
2275	organization	2	This move at least gave greater financial stability .  Between 15 October 1922 and 1 August 1923 ,  for example ,  it received 719,502 gold roubles from the tax in kind  ( its highest source of income was 1,344,639 roubles from church treasures )  .  When in September 1922 the ARA discovered that the Soviet government intended to export grain in considerable quantities , most foreign relief	organizations	joined in the hue and cry . The government gave a series of reasons for its  decision ,  some of them more plausible than others ;  but the main aim seemed to be to acquire cash or foreign credit for the rehabilitation of its industries .  More grain than expected had to be exported due to the precipitous fall in the grain price in the middle of the winter of 19223 .	None
2276	organization	2	Non - Russian papers were left to local military supervision until the end of Civil War ,  and largely to their own devices throughout 1922 ,  unless they exhibited blatant defiance of high political directives ,  as in the case of Georgia .  This did not necessarily mean that all local party chiefs in the minorities were also lethargic during 1922 .  We know from the Smolensk archive that the guberniia committee in the winter of 19223 convened meetings of many local	organizations	, compelling their members to subscribe to various Belorussian and Great - Russian newspapers . Particular stress was laid on subscriptions to Rabochii put '  ,  the guberniia party and Soviet organ .  The local peasant press was in a lamentable condition still .	None
2277	organization	2	But the task was increasingly beyond them ,  as social surveys showed the inability of the welfare services to cope with the specific needs of  the aged ,  the disabled ,  and one - parent families .  Divorces rose steadily ,  though the real acceleration in the divorce rate was to come after the Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act of 1 984 which allowed petitioning for divorce after only one year of marriage .  Especially disadvantaged were children , whose needs were dramatically highlighted by the Child Poverty Action Group and similar	organizations	. The ending of the former child allowances and their replacement with tax - free child benefits in 1975 meant an increase in the problem of dependency ,  with only about half the 750,000 one - parent families in 1976 ,  for instance ,  able to rely on their income as means of support .  An unduly high proportion of such families were black .	None
2278	organization	2	Compared with most continentals and ,  indeed ,  Americans ,  the British by this crude test were a relatively happy people .  Their democracy had remained secure .  Suggestions in 1975 of a military coup by Colonel Stirling 's non - party , non - class	organization	of apprehensive patriots or General Walker 's non - class Militia met with almost universal derision . So ,  too ,  did the alarmist outpourings of the National Association for Freedom ,  a far - right pressure - group directed by a clutch of ex - army officers and Norris McWhirter ,  better known as the author of the Guinness Book of Records  and apologist for South Africa .  At the same time ,  the British were in distinctly worried mood .	None
2279	organization	1	Ramsey made a speech which disconcerted the managers of the conference ,  who thought it a bad example of English insularity .  The speech led to a quarrel ,  soon patched up ,  with the general secretary Visser t'Hooft .  The meeting at Evanston clinched the sense of scepticism which Ramsey felt , not about the ecumenical movement , but about its inflated claims and its mode of	organization	. That scepticism and memory were to be important when he became an archbishop and was expected to be a leader in the organization .  Still ,  at Evanston ,  he allowed the personal meeting to count  with Hungarian Christians oppressed in a satellite state ,  with a black South African who merely by being there seemed to make the Afrikaaner defence of apartheid incompatible with Christianity .	None
2280	organization	1	He was clearly attracted to rural religious communities ,  such as that at Kelham where he himself participated or that seventeenth - century community of Little Gidding which he was later to celebrate .  Yet he saw the danger in making these communities an ideal ,  as he turned an anthropological eye on Christianity and perceived that such examples seem to proffer no solution to industrial urban and suburban existence  the way most people live .  Such a religious patterning of small communities reveals a Christendom fixed at the state of development suitable to a simple agricultural and piscatorial society , and so imperfectly suited to the more complicated	organization	of modern society . Eliot 's  solution of a widespread Christian community hierarchically organized ,  related both to the state and individual parishes and containing intellectual leaders ,  owes much to Benda 's  notion of clercs  ,  as well as to the anthropologists '  stress on the connection of religion with society .  As in After Strange Gods  ,  he is concerned in his conclusion with a return to sources ,   that is with going back to the savage and working forwards towards his solution to the problem of modern industrial life ;  again such a movement is presented in terms of a familiar encounter .

2281	organization	2	The attempt to locate libertarian Conservatism in the late eighteenth or early nineteenth century seems implausible .  Eccleshall appears to be on stronger ground when he looks to the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries for evidence of libertarian Conservatism .  Here he finds	organizations	like the Liberty and property Defence League ( LPDL ) and The British Constitutional Association ( BCA ) , and individuals like Lord Wemyss , Herbert Spencer , A. V. Dicey , and Ernest Benn , all committed to individualism and all found supporting the political right . Eccleshall also finds backing here from one of the recent histories of  the late Victorian and Edwardian Conservative Party. The work of Matthew Fforde appears to offer an historical lifeline to those ,  like Eccleshall ,  who would present Thatcherism in terms of an established tradition of libertarian Conservative thought .	None
2282	organization	2	If disputes within the party over policy and doctrine were one symptom of Conservative confusion ,  another was the legion of leagues which appeared in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries ,  when it seemed that hardly a year went by without the founding of some new right - wing association .  The main aim of Franz Coetzee 's  intriguing study For Party or Country  is to explain this phenomenon through an examination of the outlook and activities of three of the larger groups :  the Navy League  ( NL )  ,  the Tariff Reform League  ( TRL )  ,  and the Anti - Socialist Union  ( ASU )  .  In terms of the history of these	organizations	as institutions Coetzee 's work is unlikely to be surpassed . He examines their foundation ,  their funding ,  their social constituency ,  and their organizational structure in detail ,  and in the process disposes of a number of myths and conventional wisdoms .  For example ,  Cortzee shows that contemporary tales of the tariff reform millions ,  are not borne out by the relatively impoverished state of the Tariff Reform  League ,  and he demonstrates that the variety of industries and economic activities which were represented in the TRL defy any attempt to produce a simple definition of its interest base .

On issues like this Coetzee 's sensitivity and grasp of detail are shown to good effect : but with regard to the broader historical significance of these	organizations	he is less assured , and he leaves untouched some of the more important questions raised by his work . The leitmotif of Coetzee 's  book ,  as suggested by his title ,  is that the organizations he has studied faced an ongoing dilemma :  whether to function as adjuncts of the Conservative party or to claim that their aims were national and therefore above party .  In fact ,  as Coetzee demonstrates ,  the personnel of the TRL ,  the NL ,  and the ASU were predominantly Conservative ,  and in this respect their claim to be non - party was always weak .	None
2284	organization	2	First ,  it caused the groups some significant problems .  The NL especially suffered a major split because of its refusal after 1906 to endorse Conservative candidates .  The rival , splinter	organization	which emerged as a result , the Imperial Maritime League ( IML ) , claimed that any serious Navalist had to support the Conservatives , irrespective of the fact that individual Liberal candidates were sound on naval questions , on the grounds that collectively the Liberals were against and the Conservatives in favour of a big Navy . In the end the NL did become demonstrably pro - Conservative and saw off the IML challenge ,  but divisions like this played their part in ensuring that the British Navy League was never as large or influential as its German counterpart .  The second reason for taking the non - party claim seriously is that the various Leagues  and not just the three studied by Coetzee  were frequently critical of the Conservative party and expressed strong reservations about the effectiveness of the Conservatives as a political force .	None
2285	organization	2	That there should have been a Navy League ,  a Tariff Reform League ,  and an Anti - Socialist Union filled with Conservatives was an indication that there were many Conservative supporters who felt that the Conservative party was not doing its job properly .  There were occasions when the leagues were of great help to the Conservatives ,  but their relationship to the party was often ambivalent and sometimes hostile ,  and it was not always easy to control their activities .  It is one of the many strengths of Coetzee 's work that he recognizes the disruptive potential of the new	organizations	, but he concludes that ultimately they were of benefit to the Conservatives . It was not just that they helped out at the occasional by - election ,  but that they pointed to new sources of support whose eventual accommodation ,  and to new issues whose eventual resolution ,  would ultimately modify the party itself and help equip it for the challenges of post - war politics .  As a result of his research into the social constituency of the leagues ,  Coetzee presents them as one of the means whereby the Conservative party broadened its support amongst the middle - class and crucial lower - middle - class voters ,  thus assisting its development from a loose conglomeration of agrarian interests to the predominant party of government in urban ,  industrial Britain '	None
2286	organization	2	In so far as Whitehall had considered these matters it had been vaguely assumed that a status quo ante  would be established and the Dutch in the Netherlands East Indies ,  the French in Indochina ,  and the Colonial Office in Burma and Malaya would resume their rightful sway .  The Americans had different views ,  but they had deliberately distanced themselves from the area .  Only gradually did it dawn on those responsible that vigorous and determined nationalist	organizations	had grown up in the shadow of the Japanese , that these movements had flourished exceedingly in the vacuum left by the collapse of Japanese power , and that if the colonial regimes were to be reconstituted it could only be by force . Mountbatten 's  personal view was that the new nationalist movements should be appeased rather than suppressed and that the old colonial powers should settle for the best deal that they could get ,  pledging independence in the near future and thus ,  he hoped ,  preserving the greater part of their economic advantages .  In Burma ,  where he had only the British Colonial Office and colonial administrators to deal with ,  he was more or less able to have his way .	None
2287	organization	2	The problem of servicing debt is already ,  in practice ,  less severe than it was in the early and mid 1980s .  Relaxation of the international cold war has meant that military intervention by powerful countries from either the western or eastern blocs  from Cuba to France  will be much less frequent .  Even South Africa may decide that the returns from supporting such	organizations	as Renamo in Mozambique are extremely slim . Africa will ,  then ,  be thrown increasingly inward on herself ,  and have increasingly less reason to blame the rest of the world for her problems .  These will only be resolved in the course of an internal struggle ,  which will eventually produce governments neither more nor less enlightened than ,  for instance ,  those which have ruled over western Europe for the last five hundred years .

2288	organization	1	First of all society ,  as distinct from the State ,  had to be isolated and analysed ,  and secondly an attempt had to be made at understanding the evolution of society ,  since only then would it be possible to understand under what circumstances the State evolved and what its historical significance was .  These were the tasks first attempted in The German Ideology  .  The first task consisted of formulating a view of society which was based on principles different from the traditional ones , according to which societies could be typified in terms of their administrative	organization	by using such terms as democracy or monarchy . If we talked of society in these terms ,  Marx argued ,  we could never appreciate that the phenomena to which the terms referred were themselves only the product of a more fundamental social process .  In order to bypass this traditional way of seeing society ,  Marx turned away from administrative and political organization and tried to see society in different ,  more fundamental terms .	None

2290	organization	2	While with the ancient city state there was a unity between town and country ,  since country settlements were really extensions of the city both in the type of economic activity which took place there and in the principles of social organization in the two places ,  this was not so under feudalism .  The difference led to an important conflict between town and country .  At first the freemen of both town and country had an	organization	and a type of property which still retained something of the communal as well as something of the private , but in the town a radical transformation was taking place . This transformation was due first to the influx of runaway serfs into the towns which meant that labourers free from the personal ties of feudalism ,  but having no access to the means of production ,  became a dependent and exploitable group which was to become the proletariat .  The proletariat are free labourers in the sense that they can sell their labour to whoever will employ them ,  but are not free to do anything but  sell their labour ,  since they have no access to the means of production :  land ,  tools ,  workshops ,  raw materials .

2291	organization	1	This Engels does by showing that the Greek and Roman states ,  the sacred sources of the European ideal ,  were based on principles which can also be seen in embryo among  much less prestigious peoples ,  the American Indians .  This is dealt with in Chapters 3 ,  4 ,  5 ,  and 6 .  The third part of Engels 's discussion explains why , in spite of the presence of the State in medieval Europe , some islands of communal	organization	could and did remain . This is explained in terms of the nature of the Germanic invasions which brought about the destruction of the Roman Empire and is dealt with in Chapters 7 and 8 .  The outline of the evolutionary theory of the State in The Origin  is one we are already familiar with from the earlier writings of Marx and Engels ,  but it is expanded here with new information from Morgan .

2292	organization	1	The second part of this second half of The Origin  deals with Greece and Rome and in many ways again follows what Marx and Engels had written previously .  What is new however is the suggestion ,  which at the time of writing must have appeared as the height of impertinence ,  that the Greek and Roman states originated in much the same kind of confederation as the Iroquois .  In this way Engels asserts the generality of the principles discussed , but also he explains the importance of what he believed were remains of gentile principles in the	organization	of Greece and Rome . ( He does admit however that these remains were  in historical times at least  linked to patrilineal groups ;  rather odd inheritors of the principles of the matrilineal gens .  )  Two other general points also emerge from the discussion of Greece and Rome .

2293	organization	1	( He does admit however that these remains were  in historical times at least  linked to patrilineal groups ;  rather odd inheritors of the principles of the matrilineal gens .  )  Two other general points also emerge from the discussion of Greece and Rome .  The first is that it shows well the distinction Engels makes between general principles in this case the dissolution of communal	organization	and the rise of class and specific cases . Engels does not pretend that the histories of Greece ,  Rome ,  and the Iroquois are identical .  What he states is that the dame general principles govern their development ,  although conditions were so different that these principles had considerably different effects in the different cases .	None
2294	organization	1	The communal and the familial are not necessarily in opposition  they are matters of levels ,  and although at certain times Marx seems to see this ,  at others he does not and Engels never does .  This is because of their legitimate keenness to stress the presence of a communal principle in the history of mankind .  None the less the fact remains that the presence of descent groups tells us nothing directly about domestic	organization	. There is ,  however ,  yet another way in which modern anthropologists  could agree with Marx ,  Engels ,  and Morgan concerning the group aspect of marriage .  All would stress that our view of marriage as a private alliance concerning almost exclusively two people is totally inappropriate for most non - capitalist societies ,  especially those based on descent groups .	None
2295	organization	1	As we saw ,  most modern anthropologists would ,  like Morgan ,  stress the corporate character of descent groups and would agree that these groups cannot be understood as large families Fortes ,  1953 ,  but they would also stress that some kind of individual domestic unit seems to normally exist in societies with descent groups .  In certain other ways Morgan misled Marx and Engels more irredeemably .  Morgan believed that the only true descent groups were matrilineal , and that matrilineal descent groups gens were fundamentally different in	organization	from systems where descent was reckoned in the male line . In patrilineal descent groups ,  he argued ,  the individual family and  private property were prominent and the communal principle already moribund .  In fact ,  there seems no difference between patrilineal and matrilineal groups in this respect .	None
2296	organization	1	In patrilineal descent groups ,  he argued ,  the individual family and  private property were prominent and the communal principle already moribund .  In fact ,  there seems no difference between patrilineal and matrilineal groups in this respect .  What matters , as Morgan , Marx , and Engels rightly stress , is the corporate	organization	of descent groups , but these descent groups are just as corporate whether descent is reckoned patrilineally or matrilineally . The reason Morgan gave to explain why corporate descent groups were organized matrilineally was that since there were no individual unions within such groups one could never be sure of the identity of one 's  father .  This state of gens promiscuity is ,  however ,  imaginary and so the reasoning is irrelevant .	None
2297	organization	1	The various Dayak societies of Borneo are an example .  This greater variety than that envisaged by Morgan or Engels does certainly modify the picture .  On the whole , however , their ideas concerning the political	organization	of descent - group society , what they call the gentile constitution , are surprisingly modern and helpful and seem supported by more recent findings . The next stage in Morgan 's  and Engels 's  scheme for the evolution of political systems is characterized by confederations of different tribes .  Morgan ,  whom Engels followed ,  was once again basing himself on his studies of the Iroquois .	None
2298	organization	2	Her preference is for small charities where she feels she can do some good ,  and where she has some natural interest .  The British Deaf Association  ( BDA )  was another such charity .  This had been one of the 150	organizations	that had written asking for patronage when Diana became engaged , and had been turned down. Then ,  quite out of the blue at the end of 1983 ,  they had a letter from the Palace saying that the Princess had decided she would like to be their patron .  It was no coincidence ,  perhaps ,  that its president was the Marquess of Salisbury ,  married to Mollie Salisbury who had spent so much time helping with the garden at Highgrove .	None

Since that July day I have visited the City on numerous occasions connected directly or indirectly to asking the City for help with fund - raising .  Perhaps now is an opportunity of thanking everyone for their generosity and to say how greatly I know it is appreciated by the charities and	organizations	concerned . Be always ready ,  according to your power to relieve the poor and help the distressed is a quote from The Rules for the Conduct of Life  ,  a copy of which is given to all new Freemen  or perhaps it should now be Freepersons .

The hand of President Franois Mitterrand was detected .  Euro - elections were pending and , it was rumoured , he was doing his best to make life miserable for an	organization	which challenged his claim to the green constituency . Give the meek a good deal  join the Greens ,  announced a poster on a publicity stand in the foyer of the conference hall .  The 1000 or so members of the meek class who presented themselves at the conference ,  were ,  suitably enough ,  unruffled by having been shunted from the Sorbonne to the techno - chic sidings at Porte de la Villette .

2307	organization	2	To do that in the way the Greens proposed would require a virtually totalitarian state ,  Bryan Gould  ( at the time Shadow Trade Secretary )  told the shadow cabinet in July 1989 .  He admitted ,  though ,  that Labour was seen as too producer - oriented :  We should be able to give a value to unpolluted air ,  clean water ,  a safe environment ,  as the end - products of economic activity .  A great many green ideas were produced by Labour that summer ; a green bill to show up the deficiencies in Tory legislation ; making the quality of life the central theme in the 1990 local elections ; the mobilization of public opinion through the development of a network of environmental , countryside and energy	organizations	. The Trades Union Congress weighed in with a Green Charter ,  which included the right to hold green strikes over issues like the importation of toxic wastes .  But by the end of the year the green bill had been quietly dropped and the environmental network had vanished into a general belief in the need for good ,  informal relations with Friends of the Earth and other environmental organizations .

2308	organization	2	They were almost  but not quite  on the same side .  It could be argued ,  too ,  that they were beneficiaries of the heightened public awareness created by the increasing emphasis by government on the perils facing the environment .  Many waverers must have reached for their chequebooks and signed on with a green campaign	organization	after hearing the latest pronouncement assuring them that there really was something to worry about . There are dangers in becoming officially accepted .  Complacency and a tendency to mute criticism of governments are among them .	None
2309	organization	2	Climate change is already more important than acid rain ,  genetic engineering a more topical issue than saving whales .  Changed issues do not necessarily throw organizations into an anxious state of transition ;  if they are any good ,  they are always in transition .  That certainly applies to the three biggest international green campaign	organizations	: Greenpeace , Friends of the Earth and the World Wide Fund for Nature . They continue to grow in size and influence and they appear to be still some way from peaking .  As they grow larger ,  they grow richer ,  they spend more on research and become more authoritative .	None
2310	organization	2	This needs to be stated clearly because there is a current media clich that Greenpeace is turning its back on such tactics and is becoming a more bureaucratic ,  softer version of its earlier radical self .  This is demonstrably untrue ;  the number of direct actions continues in an upwards spiral .  What is true is that , in recent years , such actions have been backed up by sophisticated political lobbying and scientific enquiry that have added strength to the	organization	's dramatic calls for change . Greenpeace 's  continued insistence on non - violent tactics ,  even when faced with violence ,  reflects both its cultural origins and its links with the other great movements for social change in the twentieth century .  Peter Melchett ,  Greenpeace 's  Executive Director in London ,  looked at the softness issue from the aspect of whether being tough reduced influence .	None
2311	organization	2	I do n't think our direct actions are a problem reducing our effectiveness .  Politicians may not talk to us publicly ,  but they do privately .

It bills itself as the largest private conservation	organization	in the world , with offices in twenty - three countries and more than one million members . In addition to the giant panda  ( its logo )  it has reprieved  ( WWF 's  word )  the Indian tiger and the polar bear ,  the latter by persuading the five Arctic nations to restrict hunting .  The African elephant was a notable beneficiary of WWF 's  activities in 1989 ,  with two British lawyers working on its behalf during the negotiations on the Cites agreement on ivory .	None
2313	organization	2	By 1989 reserves had slipped well down the list and education and public awareness had risen .  The most significant change ,  though ,  was the appointment of a greenhouse gases and transport campaigner .  Like the other campaign	organizations	, WWF had realized that the natural world can no longer be divided into isolated sectors of activity . All are united by the threat of climate change .  Saving elephants ,  tigers and terms in the twentieth century will be a small gain if their habitats are ruined or destroyed along with man 's  in the twenty - first .	None
2314	organization	2	Most of the 2 million who belong to the National Trust  ( one of the fifteen )  do so for the sake of visiting the houses it preserves ,  not because it is green .  All the same ,  the growth rate of this group ,  all broadly linked by an interest in the countryside and the environment ,  was evidence of the power building up behind the green movement in the 1980s and 1990s .  There is an obvious danger of excessive duplication when broadly similar	organizations	conduct broadly similar campaigns . The rainforests are an obvious example .  As fund - raisers they are unparalleled .	None
2315	organization	2	There are informal networks through which we let one another know what we are doing and we meet and talk .  For instance ,  Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth had ten people each at a meeting recently  ( towards the end of 1989 )  to talk about the Green Bill and other issues .  Ad hoc alliances of green	organizations	take place from time to time , and at the end of 1988 Greenpeace , Friends of the Earth and the World Wide Fund for Nature jointly threw down a green gauntlet to the government , urging it to turn propaganda about the environment into action . A list of thirty measures ranging from recycling resources to doubling overseas aid were proposed .  It made very little impact .	None
2316	organization	2	Nearly one - third of the citizens of Leningrad are said to suffer from diseases the upper respiratory tract as a result of atmospheric pollution .  On the credit side ,  it should be said that there is now an acute awareness in the Soviet Union and the East European countries that pollution is a social and political issue and not just something that can be categorized vaguely as an environmental problem and shoved to the debit side of progress .  Miners have struck in the Soviet Union over pollution ( in combination with other matters ) and scores of green	organizations	have sprung up. The largest in the Soviet Union ,  the Social - Ecological Union ,  has 200 branches and is avowedly political in its approach .  Poverty rather than indifference is the reason for Moscow 's  inaction ,  it seems :  it was Mikhail Gorbachev who in his autumn 1988 UN speech in New York proposed that the UN should set up an emergency centre for the environment .

And the whole of the new organization was co - located in the former Air Ministry/Board of Trade building on the south side of Whitehall ,  where it is today .  Many people felt that the Thorneycroft/Mountbatten reorganization did not go far enough , and that Service Departments should have been abolished and a completely functional	organization	adopted . This would have been unwise .  The Services needed time to grow closer together :  it was just not possible to find enough officers with the experience in tri - Service co - ordination to go further in 1963 .	None
2318	organization	1	Similarly ,  although anything that exists is particular and individual ,  we can have general ideas .  On the basis of our ideas of particular men ,  we can form a general idea of man ,  and by abstracting differences from the ideas of man ,  horse ,  and lion ,  we can form still more general ideas ,  such as that of animal .  The fourth part of Gassendi 's Logic has to do with the	organization	of thought , or method . In accordance with the traditional scheme ,  he distinguishes methods of investigation and discovery from methods of teaching ,  and refers to the old notions of analysis and resolution ,  composition and synthesis .  Discoveries need to be checked ,  of course ,  so Gassendi adds the method of judgement or assessment .	None

2320	organization	1	The CPRS had been set up by Ted Heath to advise on long - term policy issues .  Its first director was Lord Rothschild and its staff was drawn both from the civil service and from outside Whitehall .  The tank had been continued by the succeeding Labour Government during which they carried out their famous inquiry into the Foreign Office which proposed fundamental changes in the	organization	of the Diplomatic Service , and they were retained by Margaret Thatcher when she took power in 1979 . Governments were not bound by their proposals and past history  as when Labour threw out the Foreign Office report  was ample proof of this .  Yet for all that ,  the charge eagerly made against us was that the Government were set on abolishing the National Health Service and privatizing health care.	None
2321	organization	2	The health service does not have a monopoly in cleaning ,  catering and laundry skills in the same way that it does in the skills required to treat sick people .  There are private companies who specialize in these services and who ,  incidentally ,  also have dedicated people working for them .  In February 1983 I announced in the House of Commons that health authorities should put their ancillary services out to tender to see whether they would get best value from private or in - house	organizations	. Six months later ,  in September ,  I followed this up with a circular to health authorities requiring them to put their services out to tender .  They were not forced to use private contractors but they were required to make a judgement on the best value for their health authority .	None

2323	organization	2	Marie Stopes 's  books ,  Married Love and Wise Parenthood may have sold widely in the early 1920s but the main readers were almost certainly the middle class .  Richard Allan Soloway 's  excellent study of the birth control movement between 1870 and 1930 may well reveal the extent to which these groups were concerned about the need to spread knowledge about birth control amongst the working classes but ,  it would seem ,  in the light of more recent research ,  that such concern was inappropriate .  Soloway 's comment that , The birth control groups found it difficult to persuade the middle and upper - class membership of the feminist	organizations	that access to the contraceptive methods was a genuine problem , seems both ill - founded and unnecessary . Indeed ,  it seems highly likely that working - class families would have controlled family size through the old ,  rather than new ,  techniques .  The evidence of the 1949 Royal Commission on Population on the use of birth control techniques ,  recognised to be inadequate on the matter ,  suggests that only 40 per cent of women married between 1910 and 1919 used some form of birth control at some time in their marriage compared with 66 per cent of those married between 1935 and 1939 .

2324	organization	2	much fuller use can be made of the machinery for joint consultation and negotiation between employers and employed .  It is more than doubtful whether we have seen the fullest possible development of machinery for joint consultation in particular industries .  And practically nothing has been done to establish effective machinery of joint conference between the representative	organizations	entitled to speak for industry as a whole . Within a few months ,  similar statements were being made by the king ,  Stanley Baldwin ,  Ramsay MacDonald ,  Ernest Bevin ,  and a whole host of trade unionists .  Indeed ,  Ernest Bevin ,  speaking at a union dinner ,  maintained that ,  if there is a new conception of the objects of industry ,  then there can be created in this country conditions which will minimize strikes and probably make them non - existent for 25 years .

2325	organization	1	Ross McKibbin and Bernard Barker feel that the Labour Party was making determined efforts to improve both its national and local organization and that ,  despite some obvious difficulties ,  it succeeded in doing so .  McKibbin ,  in particular ,  acknowledges the strengths and weaknesses of the new constituency and party organizations but stresses the overall general improvements which were achieved .  To him , however , the overriding developments were the increasing centralization of party	organization	and the growing predominance of the unions . The party could only go as far as the unions would allow and their influence was apparent at all levels .  It was the union organizations in both urban and rural constituencies which guaranteed continuity and finance :  What emerged was informal ,  often improvised ,  but remarkably tough .	None
2326	organization	2	Yet ,  although Britain suffered severe economic depression and rising unemployment ,  her economic plight was much less marked than that of Germany and Italy .  Perhaps for this reason Britain experienced little in the way of a fascist movement in the 1920s ;  only a few small and insignificant fascist groups ,  hostile to the Bolsheviks or the Jews ,  emerged at that time .  It was not until the 1930s that a more effective fascist	organization	, the British Union of Fascists ( BUF ) , was formed under the leadership of Oswald Mosley , at a time when Britain was attempting to deal with the unemployment of between 20 and 23 per cent . When the BUF developed it created something of a stir as the various political parties adjusted to its presence .  There was ,  indeed ,  quite a furore over its activities ,  and particularly at the violence associated with its Olympia Meeting of June 1934 .	None
2327	organization	2	Neither proposition is necessarily correct .  The Labour Party subsequently achieved some measure of socialism under Attlee ,  despite the hostility of capitalism ,  and the Labour Party was well informed about the real strength of the fascist challenge .  Quite rightly , the Labour Party did not wish to exaggerate the importance of a fringe political group which it had investigated in a detailed national survey , based upon a circular to the secretaries of its constituency	organizations	in 1934 . The Labour Party was well aware of the limited challenge of British fascism and could discriminate between the threat it posed compared with the more serious threat of European fascism .  This survey highlighted the fact that there were few centres of fascist support outside London ,  Manchester ,  Birmingham and Leeds  areas where there was a significant Jewish presence or where Mosley exerted some personal appeal .	None
2328	organization	2	After the conference ,  the Socialist League continued to oppose rearmament ,  opposed sanctions against Italy threatened as a result of the Italian invasion of Abyssinia ,  and advocated a policy for the Labour movement of preparing for the mass resistance to war ,  by which was meant a general strike .  In January 1937 it patched together a new united front campaign in association with the ILP ,  the Communists ,  the Left Book Club and Tribune ,  around a programme of defence for the Spanish Republic ,  opposition to rearmament by the National government ,  support for the struggles of the unemployed and the affiliation of the Communist Party and the ILP to the Labour Party. The campaign was in defiance of the Labour Party ban on joint work with the Communists and the Socialist League was condemned by the party , its members being forced to choose between disbanding the	organization	of expulsion . The Socialist League was thus dissolved in May 1937 .  The failure of the united front campaign persuaded the left of the anti - fascist movement to reconsider its strategy .	None
2329	organization	2	The size and range of the relief activities undertaken shows the strength of public support for the Spanish Republican government .  At the national level there was a National Joint Council for Spanish Relief ,  chaired by the Duchess of Atholl ,  a Conservative MP ,  though dominated by Liberal and Labour .  This committee acted as the co - ordinator for the activities of many other	organizations	, including the Spanish Medical Aid Committee , the Spain Foodship Youth Committee , the League of Nations Committee , the Peace Pledge Union , and various local councils of action and ad hoc bodies . Most towns had Aid Spain Committees ,  which collected tins of milk ,  bars of soap ,  money for medical aid as well as holding meetings to explain the cause of Republican Spain .  While many of these bodies were underpinned by Labour and working - class support it should be recognized that they attracted support from across the social and political spectrum .	None
2330	organization	2	About 7 million was being spent annually on pushing the claims of washing powders such as Tide ,  Daz ,  Omo and Persil ,  compared with 1.7 million on pushing the performances of music ,  opera ,  ballet ,  theatre and visual arts .  Now ,  for the price of its modest subscription ,  Which    and its laboratories revealed that the cleaning power of these rivals was practically identical .  Though they fell far short of the giant - killing exploits of Citizen Ralph Nader in the decade to come , the consumers '	organizations	provided a rallying point and the hard evidence to contest the claims of 450 million - worth of advertising a year , roughly the same as was spent on schools . In other respects American firms brought American techniques to bear in the opposite direction .  The advertising was American ,  led by such firms as J. Walter Thompson and applied to the products of eight hundred American firms dominating the British consumer  Thomas Hedley  ( Tide and Daz )  ,  Hoover ,  Singer ,  Heinz ,  Kellogg ,  Kraft ,  Gillette ,  Kodak ,  Woolworth ,  Colgate - Palmolive ,  Esso and Ford to name only the top twelve .	None
2331	organization	2	The House Committee published a cumulative index of names and organizations and there was the Attorney General 's  list of about two hundred organizations which were considered to have been Communist or Communist Front .  These included such subversive bodies as wartime committees for Soviet - American friendship or for Russian War Relief .  Two ex - FBI men , Vincent Hartnett and Theodore Kirkpatrick , compiled a handy compendium in book form of members of these dangerous	organizations	in the communications industry . It was called Red Channels  and a copy was standard equipment for every Hollywood producer and every radio ,  television and Madison Avenue advertising executive .  To be named in Red Channels  was to be unemployable unless you cleared yourself by making a voluntary appearance before the House Committee or McCarthy 's  Sub - Committee as a friendly witness who shopped his former friends to prove the sincerity of his repentance .

2332	organization	2	Larry Adler was blacklisted as a performer throughout the Fifties .  Even as a harmonica player he had to come to England to get work .  Adler recalls : I was listed in Red Channels for being associated with eight	organizations	. The one that counted against me most was the Anti - Fascist Refugee Committee ,  which I worked for in the late Thirties .  I was offered a deal by Roy Cohn .	None
2333	organization	2	The more militant Protestants saw this as a weakness ,  a lack of will on the part of the government .  It was now illegal to be a Protestant in a Protestant country .  The result was periodic clashes between the government and	organizations	such as Protestant Action which insisted on the right to march where they wished . Porter and Paisley were frequently to be found leading such marches and various Ministers for Home Affairs found themselves being denounced by loyalists at Orange rallies .  The first Free Presbyterian involvement in an election was a classically ad hoc  and reactive affair .	None
2334	organization	2	The city council planned to call it the Queen Elizabeth Bridge but the more assertive Protestants wanted a memorial to Lord Carson .  So angry was Ian Paisley at the affront to Carson 's  memory that he increased his tirade of abuse against O'Neill ,  produced Carson 's  son to  contest the Westminster elections in March  ( promising four Protestant Unionists in all )  and only withdrew when he realised how devoid of constituency organisation he then was .  The rudiments of a constituency	organization	were then provided . As is so often the case in Paisley 's  career ,  the crucial step was taken by someone other than Paisley and then offered to Paisley as an opportunity the possibilities of which he could appreciate .  Noel Doherty ,  a committed loyalist ,  had been a member of Paisley 's  congregation since 1956 .	None
2335	organization	2	It is important to note that it was only the statements of this man and his wife which contained any evidence of Paisley 's  knowledge of the crimes ,  and the juries determined that they were not trustworthy witnesses .  The view of Paisley 's  critics was that he was implicated but was clever enough to avoid any direct contact .  Others maintained that , even if he knew nothing of these crimes , he was morally responsible in that he had contributed substantially to the general climate which allowed members of his	organization	to believe that such acts were justified in order to destabilize the government of Terence O'Neill . This second charge is impossible to evaluate .  While it is certainly the case that Paisley was prepared to use militant rhetoric in denouncing O'Neillism ,  it is also the case that he was a vocal critic of private initiative in vigilantism and of attacks on Catholics .	None
2336	organization	2	In their view ,  the old party had been doing well .  It now had members in Stormont and increasing popular support and ,  more importantly ,  it had a clear Protestant  identity .  In many areas , it took the full weight of Paisley 's authority , exercised either directly or through loyal supporters such as Gordon Cooke , then chairman of the North Antrim branch , to persuade the Protestant Unionists to dissolve in favour of the new	organization	. In the event ,  the failure of large numbers of Official Unionists to join meant that the new party was more congenial to the old Protestant Unionists than they had initially feared .  Protestant Unionists made up about two - thirds of the new Ulster Democratic Unionist Party  ( hereafter DUP )  .	None
2337	organization	2	When the DUP was being planned in late 1971 ,  Desmond Boal kept pushing Unionists such as Austin Ardill to join the new party and received assurances from him and a number of others that they would join .  It was only their reluctance to abandon their own party which prevented the creation of a mass anti - appeasement party .  At a number of times since , there has been a genuine willingness among some of the DUP members of the United Ulster Unionist Coalition to merge their party into a new wider	organization	. Although Ian Paisley had unfailing faith in his own leadership qualities  a faith that was shared by his supporters  he was willing to work in coalition with the other unionist leaders ,  and the continued divisions within the unionist camp cannot be laid entirely at his door .  The second footnote is related to this point and it concerns the career of William Beattie .	None
2338	organization	2	In order to ensure that the Catholic population won at least one of the three seats allocated to Northern Ireland ,  the whole of the province was treated as one constituency with three members .  The election could hardly have been better designed to promote the DUP .  Although Robinson and others were achieving success in building a province - wide	organization	, the DUP 's greatest asset was its leader . Treating the whole province as a single constituency gave Paisley a chance to cash in on his considerable personal support .  Paisley was the sole DUP candidate and John Hume was the candidate for the SDLP ,  but the Official Unionists made the tactical mistake of fielding two candidates .	None
2339	organization	2	In order to do this ,  Jerry Falwell and the other Baptist pastors in the movement have to operate with almost watertight compartments for ,  on the one hand ,  their religion  ( in this box Catholics and Jews are doomed sinners )  ,  and on the other ,  their politics  ( we are all part of a shared Judeo - Christian tradition )  .  That sort of compartmentalization has been roundly denounced by Bob Jones University and those sections of American fundamentalism with which Paisley is most at home but we will never know if his religio - political system would permit such pragmatism because the constitutional issue so overrides everything else in Northern Ireland that there is no expectation or need for him to work with conservative Catholics .  This does not mean that Paisley would not be glad of the support ( such as he had in his campaign to Save Ulster From Sodomy ) of individual Catholics , but he would not work with Catholic	organizations	or officials of the Catholic Church because that might dilute his separatist witness . The Evangelicals and the Orange Order The only problems of alliances and compartmentalization faced by Free Presbyterian Democratic Unionists are those which concern the fraternal orders .	None
2340	organization	2	Nevertheless they were considerably more evangelical at the turn of the century than they are now .  The problem for the Free Presbyterians is that the fraternal orders have always seen themselves as linking the broad Protestant religious tradition with the main unionist party ,  hence the common arrangement of Orange Lodges holding their annual church parades at each of the Church of Ireland ,  Presbyterian ,  and Methodist churches in turn .  As the main churches have become more liberal , Free Presbyterianism emerged to challenge the lack of real Protestantism and hence offered an implicit challenge to the fraternal	organizations	to purify themselves by breaking their ties with the main , and now apostate , denominations . Ian Paisley was once a member of the Shankill Road Lodge of the Orange Order and a lodge chaplain ,  but he resigned from the Order when the County Grand Lodge refused to expel Sir Robin Kinahan for attending a funeral service in a Roman Catholic chapel .  Another Free Presbyterian minister ,  Austin Allen ,  resigned from the Order because it would not accept Free Presbyterian ministers as district chaplains .	None
2341	organization	2	A third Free Presbyterian minister said :  Perhaps the main reason for leaving the Orange Order was that in 1969 I was saved by the grace of God and therefore felt that I could not sit and be associated with members of the Orange and Black while they consumed alcohol in their meetings on the 12th and 13th mornings each July .   Given the Free Presbyterian Church 's  high political profile one would expect that many of its ministers would be active in the Orange Lodge ,  Black Preceptory ,  and Apprentice Boys .  Of forty - four ministers whose affiliations are known , twenty - one have never been members of any fraternal	organization	. Ten have been members of the Orange Order but nine have resigned .  Three have been members of the Independent Orange Order and one has resigned .	None
2342	organization	2	Three have been members of the Independent Orange Order and one has resigned .  Ten ministers are known to be members of the Apprentice Boys of Derry .  It would be easy to exaggerate the extent to which the lack of genuine evangelicalism in the fraternal	organizations	creates motivational problems for Free Presbyterians who wish to be active in politics . Some districts are clearly sympathetic to the Democratic Unionists and are willing to invite Free Presbyterian Democratic Unionists such as William McCrea to preach at their church parades .  Some have church parades to Free Presbyterian churches .	None
2343	organization	2	This is even more the case since the Anglo - Irish accord of November 1985 which clearly represents the British government 's  view that solutions to the Northern Ireland problem require the active involvement of the Dublin government .  For the DUP to embrace this accord and attempt to make it work would be for it to abandon its opposition to anything which presages a united Ireland .  It is usually the case that those things which best suit the Michels model are social movement	organizations	which have goals which can be compromised because they are things like an increase in workers ' standards of living or an improvement in working conditions which are divisible . Trade unionists could be persuaded to accept a moderation of their organization 's  stated goals in return for the fulfilment of part of those goals .  The position and ideology of Ulster unionists is such that their goals cannot be divided .	None

2348	paper	3	The scope or character of a piece of criticism is naturally related to the magazine or newspaper in which it appears ,  as we noticed in the case of Dore Ashton 's  dismissal from the New York Times  because it was asserted that her work could not be understood by the paper 's  readers .  The first rule for a reader of articles is thus to find a sympathetic publication .  Some trial and error should eliminate the laziest	papers	, whose critics do no more than pillage catalogue introductions , or even press releases . Some latitude can be allowed to serious critics who write for periodicals which go to press a long time before a show is on view ;  these critics will not be able to comment on how the exhibition actually looks ,  as their articles will have been written before the show 's  installation .  They  nevertheless will have seen some ,  perhaps all the works included ,  and can thus comment usefully on the artist 's  standing ,  aims and achievements .	None
2349	paper	4	Choices for subsidies are in themselves art critical judgements ,  just as commissions are ,  and public debate can become enflamed over commissions .  The art critic has no decisive voice in such controversies ,  though arguments can be made by analogy from existing art to what may be done .  Another form of article which can include art criticism is a theoretical	paper	. For example ,  the cultural theory of the 1970s ,  according to an article by Victor Burgin on The End of Art Theory  ,  drew predominantly on feminism ,  Marxism ,  psychoanalysis and semiotics .  In his view the independence of modernism in art has been further subverted by the demonstration of the necessarily intertextual nature of the production of meaning .	None

The Shah had made a showplace of his country with his colossal purchasing of weapons ,  and look what it had all come to :  If you drive from Shiraz to Isfahan even today you 'll see hundreds of helicopters parked off to the right of the highway .

2351	paper	4	According to the Guardian  ,  the New Year 's  Honours list of 1988 in Britain contained a knighthood for Professor Albert Maillard ,  the Oxford historian .  Two of the several names owned by another recipient had strayed into someone 's  word - processor to create a further deserving don ,  the knowing reference to whom must have ruined the new year for more than one senior scholar .  I feel that Albert Maillard , if he existed , would have no time for Kapuscinski 's impressionism , for his absence of dates , figures and state	papers	, and that Albert Maillard would be wrong . There is history in the  accounts Kapuscinski gives of the confusions and uncertainties which he has experienced and which he has tried to interpret .  All is not dark in these accounts ,  and indeed they can be said to gleam with a quality of reflected light .	None

2355	paper	2	However ,  the policy is seen as ambiguous .  Those who wish ,  both unionists and nationalists ,  can interpret it as the beginnings of absorption into an all - Ireland state .  But those who wish for a basically Northern solution , even a dual national state with inputs both from the Republic and Britain , can interpret the policy as suiting their needs , and can thus find space on the ballot	paper	for the SDLP . While in the last century there was still some attempt to embrace  all people in Ireland as the Irish nation ,  now the nation subsists in the Irish catholic population .  The ambiguity present in O'Connell has arguably aided catholic nationalists over the years in the justification of their policies .	None

Not that I wish to say ,  he wrote ,  that everything is inevitable ,  on the contrary ,  I wish to assert emphatically that nothing is inevitable and nothing was inevitable ,  neither what I did nor what I thought ,  neither what I felt nor what I suffered ,  yet everything was necessary ,  a necessary beginning and necessary  Harsnet  ( typed Goldberg )  is misleading ,  since it was only after I had begun that I knew I had begun ,  while before I had begun ,  before the 27 July 1967 ,  there was no beginning ,  as there was no end ,  there was no time and there was no freedom from time ,  only endless cups of coffee ,  endless cups of tea ,  endless biscuits and endless bacon sandwiches .

We have also followed his preparations for the world title bout with Karpov ,  some of us ,  it must be confessed ,  with a certain amount of incredulity ,  since ,  however much these world championship matches are now dependent on stamina rather than brilliance ,  it has struck more than a few people that a chess player is not a footballer ,  in particular a fifty - year - old self - exiled Russian Grandmaster is not a footballer ,  and that to think that by training like one he will become as fit is not only an illusion ,  it is a dangerous illusion .

Then again for reasons of established cultural preference we had to go back to the Audit Commission and ask them to translate 6.358 million into real men ,  for we had difficulty in trying to sell such an alien concept to the police mind .  In effect their fiscal mandate meant their version of reality failed to synchronize with the police world view .	None
2373	paper	3	Certainly the social sciences are seen to be the arbiters of revolutionary change which might somehow dismantle the police institution and its processes ,  and this has led it to negate the reforming social scientists ,  keeping them as outsiders beyond the system .  A further example from the Police Foundation Oxford Conference gives some indication of the different perspectives which exist for the analytic researcher and the practical policeman :  Barrie Irving , the Police Foundation director has presented a	paper	today outlining research into the Police and Criminal Evidence Act ( PACE ) . Having some 1979 data on custody practices and prisoner interviews he sought to replicate the study in 1986/7 to assess the influence of the legislation on police practice .  Claiming significant differences in post - PACE activities he suggested these showed the need for legal measures to impact upon police practice and influence change .	None
2374	paper	4	Although rarely defined ,  it is often on the lips of the members ,  so that the phrase ,  I do n't want to seem disloyal ,  but will often preface even the mildest internal criticism of any of the systems of policing .  This total reverence to the group binds ideas of silence ,  loyalty ,  and reticence together to create a positive category for belief and action and ,  in turn ,  links silence to other concepts of respect for the order of the institution .  In consequence , even the publication of an academic seminar	paper	carried out without formal approval could form a breach in the regulated structures of police existence and be subject to disciplinary control . In such a world ,  the easy resolution of the ethical dilemma remains problematic ,  for as Anne Akeroyd  ( 1984 :  134 )  recognizes there is not ,  nor ever likely to be any definitive agreement about the nature of either the problems or solutions facing the social scientist and the question of ethics .  I have never completely resolved my own dilemma ,  for I do not think it has a simple resolution .	None

Nothing in this order changes the already existing practices exercised in connection with courses or papers overseen by the Regional Inspector Training Unit or Police College .  In these cases a Senior Police Officer has first read of any	papers	and all other personnel involved have been required to enter into an undertaking to respect the security of the information .

Any criteria for defining privileged information ,  or what the dangers are in revealing such matters as dispositions  ( of manpower )  are so vaguely incorporated as to  ensure that few will risk submitting an essay without approval ,  which might later be assessed as an improper disclosure .  The creation of this order at the time a new Official Secrets Bill was being pushed through Parliament by an increasingly interventionist government is significant ,  and the idea of a senior officer 's  having first read of any essay to maintain the integrity of the institution manifests the importance of the legalized surveillance of allegedly dangerous material and enhances the separation of the world of control from that academic enquiry ;  although its implementation is only randomly applied .

As it is , when I showed close colleagues my first working	paper	( Young 1979a ) on experiences in a police bridewell ( see Chapters 2 and 3 ) , they were alarmed . I was told on more than one occasion ,  that I should not really let outsiders see this sort of thing ,  even though it was agreed that what I had written was an accurate analysis of events .  In some respects ,  I think it was the detail of the ethnographic thick description which most alarmed them ;  for as almost all of them wistfully pointed out :  it shows exactly how we do the business .

2378	paper	3	The Staff College should be a place where serving officers have the opportunity to contemplate society as a whole and in particular to study and consider those liberal and humane values which are central to our society .  The college should have as its prime concern the nurture of ethics and integrity ;  they are the core of any professions .  Such a proposal is now of another era , however , and I was present when an ex - Dean of Academic Studies at the college presented a	paper	( Stead 1980 ) attacking the trend to expensive , amalgamated police units which had grown up in the previous two decades . The appetite for power these immense forces display worried Stead ,  and he argued their style could only lead to an autocratic national system with a minister of central government at the apex .  His fears seem to be well founded ,  for a move towards regionalization is now occurring ,  with a proposal that the forty - three forces disappear into perhaps eight or nine giant regional units .

2380	paper	4	He dismissively described how this man had come in ,  taken the material provided ,  and then had written a childish and critical book on the police ,  out of which he got a Ph.D .  Again a metaphorical breach of a sacred boundary has occurred and an enemy made a gain at the expense of the integrity of the inside !  It is this logic of practice which effectively negates most research and is perhaps the main reason that between 1979 and 1988 , only one of the research	papers	I have compiled has been looked at by senior officers . Neglectful silence is ,  of course ,  the most perfect means of maintaining the powerful integrity of the institutional boundaries against any criticisms .

2382	paper	3	And even if an uncommissioned but critical ethnography is not considered to be in breach of the Official Secrets Act ,  it will most likely be construed as structural espionage and lie in breach of the Police Discipline Code as set out in Police Regulations .  Any internal disciplinary measure to contain such an account is much less likely to become of public concern in the way that the Clive Ponting or the Cathy Massiter prosecutions became notorious causes clbres  .  As a result of this all pervading desire for reticence it is possible to suggest that the presentation of research	papers	in seminars , the creation of an undirected thesis , not to mention the production of a book , could easily have placed me in breach of Regulation 6 , which outlines the disciplinary offence of Improper disclosure of information ,  which offence is committed where a member of a police force  ( a )  without proper authority communicates to any person ,  any information which he has in his possession as a member of a police force That I avoided such a course of action is because of my own understanding of what the institution would allow before it swung into action .

2383	paper	0	Our lists contained the names of the family prigs we knew were professional thieves and burglars ;  and of whom I was advised on my arrival in the department by an old detective :  you only get one chance a year to nail these bastards if you are lucky ,  so when you do ,  its got to be watertight .  Again the litism in the department is largely symbolic ,  for although  detectives talk continuously of their special knowledge of the world of prigs ,  and despise the uniform branch as wollies ,  often it is the uniform polis who responds to a call and effects the capture ,  after which the detective moves in to squeeze him dry .  The detective has therefore moved away from the centrally important activity of seizing the villains into a manipulated world where the	paper	exercise of statistical detections is used to assuage politicians , the media , and a public obsessed with the moral panic of increasing crime rates . Furthermore ,  the detectives are no longer in that basic symbol of police identity  the uniform .  They are less constrained and have more individuality in their civvy clothes ,  although there are strict ,  but unwritten rules about what is acceptable dress  ( sombre suits and ties )  and what is disordered and undisciplined  ( jeans ,  T - shirts ,  training shoes ,  and the like )  .

2391	paper	0	Lucy 's  mood had rallied .  Her eyes were sparkling ,  cheeks flushed ,  body clad in a sea - green that lit the depths of her eyes ,  her beautiful eyes .  And she produced a sheaf of exhibition	papers	with a flourish ; she 'd even written some of the wording to go under the photos . Neat and brilliant !  And she loved the stills Jay had dug out ;  her lovely lips tasted the Melina Mercounand she raised her glass to Jay .	None
2392	paper	2	That 's   sexual inequality !  She made a huge pot of strong coffee .  Pushed books and	papers	into piles , threw discarded clothes into the bedroom .

2393	paper	7	Tides and tears had faded and roughened every strand .  Her bedroom had become a nest .  A crow 's nest high above the street , a magpie 's nest , phone light fire scads of books juice vitamin pills cold tea tobacco	papers	matches ashtray diary address book radio all within reach of the heap of pillows and quilts , tangled sheets and herself .

2394	paper	5	The woman 's  room was bare as Jay 's  .  So Jay drifted next door for her dregs of brandy .  And the woman whose name , it happened , was Aurora whittered on about an infidelity performed against her by a titled husband , an imminent divorce , a Sunday	paper	scandal .

2396	paper	7	He shouldered towards them and asked ,  What is going on   Donald McCulloch was jubilant .  Oh , three of the Duke 's boobies from Blair Castle came riding up with bits of	paper	some rubbish about the Act .

2397	paper	7	Who can tell   They are in English ,  Donald said contemptuously .  Beside the Cross one of the men had torn a	paper	into little bits and scattered them , to a groaning catcall from the crowd .

2398	paper	1	He scanned it  it was little more than a text of the Act .  He reminded himself of the details and exulted as he saw what he could do with it .

2401	paper	7	Donald McCulloch was grinning to his friends .  It is a poor thing ,  he called out ,  when ministers turn recruiting sergeants !

2402	paper	2	The factor jumped back .  McCulloch laughed and turned away .  Cameron folded the	paper	and gave it to James Menzies . Let us meet outside the gates ,  he said ,  and draw up the day 's  work .  And take a vote on it 	None
2403	paper	7	But other things mattered more .  Another castle to be stormed .  For the sake of a scrap of	paper	. His sudden lapse of morale took him by surprise ,  like a qualm in his stomach .  No food since broth and bread last night .	None
2404	paper	2	James bowed ironically and offered them the document ;  Alexander Menzies pretended to think about it for a full five minutes and signed it with  extraordinary flourishes that made the pen splutter and seemed to say ,  Very well ,  I will humour your ridiculous ritual .  James was remembering the young man now ,  William ,  the laird 's  son ,  a surgeon in the Army ;  here was trouble .  The young man scanned the	paper	, held it out , and as James 's fingers reached for it , dropped it , eyed him , and said in a carrying voice , I see you are mad , but does even a lunatic suppose that one of His Majesty 's officers would bind himself to oppose the law and refrain from arresting criminals  They went for him then ,  Alexander and Donald McLaggan ,  the Duke 's  two sons ,  dragged him from his father 's  side so that his head bounced on the steps ,  lifted him bleeding ,  like foresters keeping a dying deer clear of the hounds ,  and started to carry him down to the river just to cool him off but Cameron ran and gripped Donald 's  shoulder and shouted ,  If you injure an officer it is treason on top of sedition ,  so they carried him back and laid him carefully at his father 's  feet .  Cameron was thinking ahead now .	None
2405	paper	2	They might have become becalmed there as their heads ballooned with the drink but the Duke told his piper to rouse their feet with a steady march ,  Murdo Mackenzie of Torridon ,  and they headed off downstream towards Grandtully past the standing stone ,  the quiet watcher ,  while damp black shadow massed in the river - channel as though the night came from there .  on the far bank Cameron had outstripped them ,  his army moving steadily down the strath ,  winning signatures at the house of Cluny ,  at Clochfoldich and Pitnacree ,  by the solid slow avalanche of their numbers ,  massing quietly round each house ,  hammering three times on each door .  By this time every gentleman knew what was expected of him : Cameron never dismounted , he leaned from the saddle and passed the	paper	down to the angry , helpless proprietor and took it back signed . The west windows of Hope Steuart 's  place at Ballechin flared with sunset ,  as though fires blazed inside it .  Cameron passed it by ,  the man could stew in his choler for a while ,  and when the dark came on and his servants and womenfolk grued at every owl - call or salmon - splash from the river ,  his defiance would burn lower and he would give his name .	None
2406	paper	2	Hope Steuart had leaned two loaded muskets against the doorjambs ;  he turned to pick one up but the Duke 's  two sons were on him ,  twisting his arms behind him. He struggled and roared out ,  I see you ,  James Menzies ,  I charge you with sedition ,  and the Duke roared back ,  We charge you  with tyranny ,  trail him round the house ,   lads ,  show his servants who is the master now .  They carted him like a scarecrow , his heels scoring the gravel , but he was as stubborn as a pig in a cart , he would never squeal without a hard prod ; Donald Stewart the blacksmith had to grip his wrist to make him sign the	paper	.

2409	paper	7	Do you think it is enough   Nothing is enough ,  so long as we have no hand in government .  We are putting	paper	chains on their arms ; they can break them with a gesture . They stopped and looked at each other and James laughed .  We  are talking ourselves into a fine slough !	None

2456	paper	7	Peter tried to rouse his countrymen from their aboriginal stupor and turn them into Europeans ;  but a Russian is n't and ca n't be a German or a Frenchman ,  and the result of Peter 's  efforts was to produce an educated class who ca n't be Russians either .  They can of course call themselves Slavophils ,  but that is to try and wish away Peter ,  to perform an act of mental regression ,  not to be a Russian .  It is a	paper	situation , inflammable and precarious . The dangerous consequences of Peter are much canvassed in the notebooks :  the social unsteadiness  (  shatost  )  ,  as Shatov says .

Uniting boredom , provinciality , the Gadarene stampede , and	paper	with something written on it . This boredom rotates upon a frivolous - menacing ,  frenetic - slack ,  comic - terrible axis which is the book 's  living principle .

Thomson 's  latest letters to the media very ,  but in some he explains the decades of delay with a puzzling tale of his attempts to shield the Blumleins from the belated discovery that a person close to them had supplied me with letters stolen from the late Mr A K Van Warrington .  As before , Thomson , who has also put out calls for biographical material on other subjects , including S G Brown , signs himself a Member of the Institution of Electrical Engineers , helping establish credibility with editors unaware of the fact that he started collecting original	papers	in 1972 . But he has published nothing ,  refuses third parties access to his collection and will not catalogue what he has .  Although some editors have treated the biographer 's  latest call with suspicion and either ignored his request or published it with qualification  ( eg Hi - Fi News  ,  other have simply regurgitated Thomson 's  plea for letters ,  notes and photographs .

Thomson 's  siphon recorder An operation , a moving coil D'Arsonval galvanometer connected to the line was arranged so that coil deflections , brought about by an incoming signal , controlled movement of a writing head across a moving	paper	tape . The tape was driven by either an electric or clockwork motor and the writing head was supplied with ink from a reservoir by siphon action ,  as the tape was being driven .

I move towards the conclusion of this Chapter by invoking a further term in the sequence of titles quoted above : a recent	paper	by David Lodge called After Bakhtin . Bakhtin is a latecomer on the anglophone critical scene .  His major work was done in Russia in the 1930s and 1940s ,  he suffered Stalinist repression ,  was partly rehabilitated ,  and died in 1975 ,  at a time when very few people in the West had heard of him.

2466	paper	4	Norris virtually admits as much from time to time .  Discussing Of Grammatology  ,  he says he will treat it as a book with a theme ,  even though Derrida wants to discourage such an approach to it .  Derrida 's famous	paper	Structure , Sign and Play aroused much excitement when it was delivered at a conference on structuralism at Johns Hopkins in 1966 , and has since acquired a mythological significance as the fountainhead of American deconstruction . In so far as that essay gives some warrant to the idea of free - for - all hermeneutics ,  then ,  concedes Norris ,  Structure ,  Sign and Play ' is a text which ,  at least in its closing paragraphs ,  falls below the highest standards of Derridean argumentative rigour .  Despite these occasional reservations ,  Norris writes as a disciple ,  who believes that other disciples ,  as well as Derrida 's  enemies ,  have got him wrong .	None
2467	paper	3	There is the further consideration that universities may not indefinitely be secure havens for literary criticism ,  in the cold economic climate and rampant anti - intellectualism of Thatcherite Britain ,  and of many other parts of the world .   When English was established in British universities criticism played at best a minor part in it .  There was a critical	paper	in the Oxford degree , but the emphasis was substantially on scholarship of a tough traditional kind , without much concession to the Arnoldian free play of mind . For a long time Oxford English was directed towards scholarship and was suspicious of criticism ,  and this attitude was reflected in its house organ ,  The Review of English Studies  .  Helen Gardner ,  for many years an Oxford luminary ,  did not believe that the purpose of English was to turn out critics ,  any more than it was to produce poets and novelists .	None
2468	paper	3	Until recently ,  graduate teaching was a very marginal activity .  In the United States the graduate school is the major arena of pedagogic activity and intellectual life .  It is here that research	papers	are generated and read and discussed , and where the academic superstars go through their paces and inspire their dedicated students . As early as 1921 ,  the Newbolt Report ,  summarizing the evidence of  Professor Ernest de Slincourt ,  expressed deep unease about the American approach to literary research :  Many of the elaborate theses on English Literature produced by American students for their Doctorate ,  and afterwards published ,  were monuments of misdirected effort ;  in short ,  a true sense of literature as a living thing was lost ,  and in its place was substituted an investigation after the worse pattern of German research ,  deadening alike to those who wrote and those who read it .

2469	paper	4	The task of the academic is to teach and engage in research ,  and ,  if required ,  to take on administrative duties .  Although there is parity of esteem among academic subjects ,  and dog is careful not to eat dog ,  at least in public ,  a scientific model of knowledge has ,  I believe ,  come to dominate the modern academy ,  and to affect attitudes to and within humanistic learning .  Such knowledge is progressive , rendering earlier versions of itself obsolete , and it circulates quickly and visibly through the accepted professional channels , like journals and conference -	papers	. It is also subject to quantifiable assessment ,  in terms of volume of publication ,  frequency of citation ,  amounts of research funding ,  and the calibre of referees .  In English Studies this is the world of Morris Zapp ,  not of Phillip Swallow .	None

Scattered through the policy review are proposals to :  Drastically alter the status and organisation of the Department of Trade and Industry ;  Create two departments  a Department of Consumer Affairs ,  and a Department for Legal Administration ;  Create a Department of Environmental Protection within the existing Department of the Environment ;  Set up a plethora of new commissions and executive agencies ;  Set up a Women 's  Ministry .  Those are only the most overt changes advocated in the review	papers	. The only department which explicitly escapes unscathed is the one which Conservatives would most like to abolish :  the Department of Energy .  In virtually every case the aim of causing upheaval is explicitly declared ,  because Labour 's  aim would be to upset the bureaucratic order it inherits .	None

The press ,  at Ivry ,  a suburb south - east of Paris ,  is the most technologically advanced in Europe and will enable Le Monde to print in colour and to produce 64 - page newspaper ,  a third as much again .  With so many pages , the decision to divide the	paper	into separate sections : home and foreign news , society and culture , economics and business news with special supplements , books and ideas on Friday , arts and listings on Thursday and a radio/television guide at the weekend , has been dictated by the problems of readability as much as anything else .

Under the Alternative Vote voters mark their ballot	papers	in order of preference first preference with a figure 1 , second with a figure 2 , and so on . If no candidate wins more than half the first preference votes ,  the candidate with the fewest first preference votes is excluded ,  and his or her votes are transferred to the remaining candidates ,  according to the voters '  second preferences .  That process is repeated until one candidate clears 50 per cent .	None

If anything , the	papers	are growing yet more adventurous , and they are certainly not expensive , at between three and five kopecks ( pence ) a copy .

2521	paper	3	Labour will now enter a phase of trying to popularise its reviewed policies ,  while refining details in some areas .  The successful delivery of the party 's  policy review this week was capped when the conference agreed yesterday to the next major change Mr Kinnock intends to carry through :  a diminution in the overwhelming dominance of the union block vote .  He is also keen to press on with modernising the party 's policy - making machinery , a process which took a jump forward yesterday when delegates approved an executive consultation	paper	on the block vote and reform of the conference .

But there was no such domination .  Two of the five	papers	presented at the seminar disapproved of such censorship .

2529	paper	4	Hostels Researchers at The Policy Studies Institute were commissioned by the then Department of Health and Social Security to study the extent to which hostels for the needy provided care as well as accommodation and food ,  to enable the department to decide if ,  how ,  and by whom they should be funded .  Its report published in July last year ,  The Cost of Care in Hostels ,  concluded :  Even hostels offering relatively low care were still offering some care ,  and had to spend more than could be explained simply in terms of the costs of accommodation .  On the same day the DHSS published a consultation	paper	proposing changes which would deprive many of income . The report called Help with Hostel Charges ,  Proposals for Change cited the PSI study and stated :  Many hostels provided little or no care to their residents .  Where care is provided ,  it is far more often in the form of advice than of assistance with physical care.	None

2532	paper	0	The document ,  leaked to the Unemployment Unit ,  also suggests that making Restart courses for the unemployed compulsory for certain groups could help the service deal with more poorly - motivated clients .  It could also justify a bid for some limited additional resources from central government .  The	paper	admits that employment is the destination of only a minority of those who leave the unemployment register after two years . The main cause of the projected reduction of the group over the PES  ( Public Expenditure Survey )  period will be reduced inflows to long - term unemployment rather than the  ( slightly )  reduced outflows .  Michael Meacher ,  Labour 's  employment spokesman ,  last night said :  The formula is not just another in the long line of bureaucratic barriers which prevent the unemployed claiming benefit .	None

Junge Welt printed a photograph of some demonstrators .  The most high - level discontent appeared in an extraordinary open letter to the same	paper	, the organ of the Free German Youth ( SDJ ) . The president of the Writer 's  Association ,  Hermann Kant ,  a central committee member ,  said the exodus of almost 50,000 refugees could not be blamed on the wicked class enemy in West Germany :  A defeat is a defeat even if it comes on the eve of a glorious celebration .

2536	paper	4	The UK was not alone in thinking that the original proposal was too rigid and paid insufficient regard to market forces .  The EC Commissioner now responsible for tax ,  France 's  Christiane Scrivener ,  shuffled out of the meeting unusually declining to speak to journalists .  Last week , she outraged her Commission colleagues by suggesting that the government 's	paper	, which has unanimous backing , might prove irresistible .

Newspapers , apart from the party	paper	Neues Deutschland , began to drop the pretence that the troubles were not the main concern throughout the country . The Union ,  organ of the puppet Christian Democratic Union Party ,  even admitted giving a one - sided picture of them .

Ministers will decide in January exactly how council performance should be measured and they want assessments to begin in April .  A consultation	paper	published yesterday suggested the proportion of rent collected , the amount of rent arrears , the number of empty properties and the average cost and waiting time for repairs must be included . The minister also said a framework for securing the future of shared ownership schemes in rural areas ,  offering part - rent ,  part - purchase deals ,  had been agreed with the Housing Corporation .

We 've certainly criticised this Chancellor ,  and we 've certainly criticised Tory governments in the past .  Sir David , knighted in 1982 , has swung his	paper	behind critical issues : it started campaigning on environmental issues a year ago just as the Conservatives switched tack .

Talented staff began to leave .  A working group which was debating ways of running a common staff , increasingly became dominated by the apparent overmanning of both	papers	. By July ,  the relatively calm mood of The Daily Telegraph was badly infected with rumours that more than 100 redundancies were required in the staff of 440 .  Andrew Knight says now that there was no target .	None
2545	paper	1	By July ,  the relatively calm mood of The Daily Telegraph was badly infected with rumours that more than 100 redundancies were required in the staff of 440 .  Andrew Knight says now that there was no target .  He wanted the same efficiency on the	papers	as on newly - founded ones . Sub - editors ,  who work long evenings ,  currently do a four - day week ,  he says .  If they work five days ,  there would ,  in theory ,  be a 20 per cent increase in periods worked ,  therefore on paper you would need a fifth fewer people .	None

Meanwhile the	paper	imposed a 4 per cent pay deal , sweetened with merit money , an action which further inflamed feelings and led to industrial action and set Monday 9 October as the date when all would be revealed . It was also to be Andrew Knight 's  last executive action :  he is becoming a non -  executive deputy chairman as Conrad Black ,  holding 80 per cent of the shares ,  assumes daily control .

The talk is of bondage to the	paper	: under a highly restrictive contract . So what began ,  apparently ,  as an attempt to strengthen the weakest paper of the group has convulsed the main profit - earner .  Whether this is the start of a deliberate confrontation ,  or the result of bad management of the kind which provoked BBC staff to strike this summer there is every sign that Mr Black wants his staff on a far tighter rein .

2550	paper	2	While city leaders in Leipzig held talks with reformists ,  reports indicated that police in Halle had made a baton attack on about 3,000 people as they were leaving a church to march in silence round the town .  Many were clubbed to the ground and kicked .  Shortly after Gunter Krusche , a leading figure in the East Berlin Protestant church , said there were signs that the reformist New Forum would be granted legal status in several regions , police in East Berlin detained 15 members of the group and confiscated	papers	they were carrying . The 15 were later released .  There was a telling indication that the police and other forces who have to impose Communist rule were not immune to the general discontent .	None
2551	paper	5	By PATRICK MARNHAM PARIS  The pilot of the UTA DC10 which exploded over the Sahara desert on 19 September ,  killing all 171 people on board ,  had previously complained of lax security on the Libreville to Paris route ,  according to a report in Le Canard Enchaine ,  writes Patrick Marnham .  The	paper	quotes documents which suggest the pilot learnt that the French authorities had received several bomb threats against UTA 's African flights which were not passed on to him. The Ministry of the Interior and UTA have repeatedly denied that any bomb warnings were received .  The airline actually withdrew special security precautions shortly before the DC10 went down.	None
2552	paper	2	Later Eichmann ,  faced with a lack of rail transport ,  began a programme of deportations by foot  death marches along a 120 - mile route from Budapest to the Austrian border at Hegyeshalom .  Ignoring attempts on his life ,  and constant threats ,  Wallenberg used every means possible to outwit the executioners ,  bribing Hungarian and German officials ,  threatening the Gestapo and issuing Swedish passports which ,  surprisingly ,  offered some protection in a period hardly renowned for respect for the law. He began by giving official passports to Jews who could claim some vague connection with Sweden , and ended by thrusting , in defiance of the Gestapo , cyclostyled	papers	bearing his signature into the hands of anyone he could reach , in the cattle trucks in railway sidings or along the road as the tragic columns struggled by . Gideon Hausner ,  the Israeli lawyer who prosecuted Eichmann in 1961 ,  estimates that Wallenberg personally saved 30,000 Jews in Budapest .  Others claim that some 100,000 owe their lives to his efforts .	None
2553	paper	2	The White Paper on changes to the Scottish legal profession published yesterday by Malcolm Rifkind ,  the Secretary of State for Scotland ,  says that once trained ,  Scottish solicitors should have unrestricted rights of audience in the higher courts ,  with the standard of performance achieved in training as the sole test .  Any rule directly or indirectly restricting solicitors '  freedom to undertake all the actions necessary for the preparation and presentation of cases will need the approval of both the Secretary of State and the Lord President of the Court of Session .  But in what the Law Society also interpreted yesterday as a clear shift in emphasis from the English proposals , the	paper	makes it clear that the role of the Lord President would be no different from the one he currently exercises when approving training and professional rules . Under the English White Paper ,  rights of audience rules drawn up by the Law Society in conjunction with an advisory committee will be subject to the concurrence of four senior judges .  The society fears that the Bar and judges will exert subtle pressure to build in case separation requirements .	None

We launched a manifesto promoting positive aspects of our field ,  including a call for a clear statement of principle for the collection and use of official statistics .  Later this year we will be publishing a more comprehensive	paper	on this topic outlining what we feel needs to be done to ensure the integrity of official statistics , but in general we believe that there are three principles : 1 . Decisions about data collection should be determined by the need for an informed society as well as for the concerns of government ;  2 .  All statistics collected with public funds should be in the public domain ;  3 .	None
2557	paper	5	On Tuesday The Hindu printed copies of supposedly secret Swedish government documents which purported to confirm that ,  despite denials in India and Sweden ,  Indian middlemen had received huge payoffs as part of the contract .  The Hindu report infuriated the opposition in parliament and there were renewed demands for the resignation of Mr Gandhi ,  who has repeatedly been accused of attempting to cover up the scandal .  The Hindu promised fresh disclosures the next day , but Wednesday 's	paper	contained no more reports .

2559	paper	4	Ball 's  estrangement from the Salvation Army was to be the secular brass band 's  gain. Soon after the Second World War ,  in which he worked with ENSA  ( or Every - Night - Something - Awful ,  as he called it )  ,  he came to work for the music publishing firm of R. Smith and Co Ltd and served as editor of British Bandsman  ( the brass band world 's  leading newspaper since 1887 )  for 15 years .  Here he invested the	paper	with some of the most wisely conceived editorial pieces in its long history and was a great Christian witness in the world of secular bands . His success as a conductor of contesting bands was immediate ,  with victories at the National Brass Band Championships in 1946  ( with Brighouse and Rastrick Band )  and at the Belle Vue September Contest ,  Manchester ,  in 1948 and 1952 ,  with the now - defunct Co - operative Workers Society  ( CWS )  Manchester Band ,  being the highlights .  In time ,  he was welcomed back to the Salvation Army ,  who even arranged for a star bearing his name to be laid on Hollywood Boulevard alongside those of the great movie stars .	None
2560	paper	2	Sir Terence adds that he is enclosing for Christopher Patten a copy of the rules which the Cabinet Office has issued for the guidance of officials on such exercises .  Gordon Brown ,  Labour 's  shadow to the Treasury chief secretary ,  said yesterday that he and Jack Cunningham ,  Labour 's  environment spokesman ,  had been shown additional internal Government papers which proved that the Conservative Party had asked the Treasury and individual departments to cost Labour 's  policy review according to Tory Central Office assumptions .  Mr Brown refused to say how the	papers	had been shown to him or to disclose their further contents . But he added that government departments had been asked to complete forms and return them to the Treasury .  What the documents conclusively reveal is that ministers asked the civil service to cost the Labour review using figures and interpretations provided by the Conservative Party.	None

The avalanche of red tape surrounding events such as this ( the entire population of New Delhi appears to be employed handing out forms to fill in ) has to be seen to be believed , and it is by no means certain that , come 1 November , there will be any	paper	left to provide the winners with their cheque .

Senior ministers were clearly disappointed last night at the news , but said they wanted to study the	papers	before commenting publicly .

2570	paper	5	Both BBC viewers and those who did not watch the BBC were agreed on balance that it was biased towards the Conservatives though those who actually watched it were more evenly divided on the direction of BBC bias than those who did not  ( Table 6.1 again )  .  ( For corroborative figures see IBA ,  1987 ,  p. 17 .  )    In sharp contrast , three quarters of all newspaper readers said that the	papers	gave biased coverage of the Alliance .

Roughly four - fifths of Sun ,  Express ,  Mail  ,  and Telegraph  readers said their paper was biased towards the Conservatives ,  while a similar number of Mirror  readers said their paper was biased against the Conservatives .

None
2573	paper	5	Conversely those who read left - wing papers were largely agreed that they were anti - Conservative and pro - Labour but more divided on whether they had an anti - Alliance bias .  perceptions of both total and net bias increased during the campaign .  Readers of right - wing	papers	became more aware of their anti - Conservative , pro - Labour bias ( Table 6.3 ) . Age ,  education ,  ideology ,  even strength of partisanship ,  had little influence over whether or not people perceived bias on television or in their papers .  Detection of bias was also unrelated to motivations for following the campaign or interest in politics during the campaign .	None
2574	paper	0	people tended to see television as biased against their own party while they thought their paper was biased towards their own party .  They asserted ,  rather than denied ,  the bias in their own preferred papers .  No doubt they chose their	paper	partly with that bias in mind .

2575	paper	5	But on helping them decide how to vote ,  opinion was much more evenly divided :  36 per cent preferred television ,  24 per cent the press ,  and a remarkable 40 per cent said the two sources were equally useful  ( Table 6.12 )  .  For providing issue - information ,  persistent readers of the Sun  or Star  preferred television to the press by 67 per cent to 12 per cent :  a majority of 55 per cent .  Sun/Star readers ' preference for television as a source of issue - information was just as great as that of people who did not read any	paper	regularly . Next came Mirror readers ,  who preferred television to the press by a majority of 35 per cent ,  and Express/Mail  readers ,  who preferred television by a majority of 25 per cent .

Everywhere ,  transistors give off the Reggae beat ,  making the place a party that never stops ,  and that might catch fire .   A sense of mystery and futility is imparted by events at the Grange and on the Ridge , and that sense is heightened by what takes place in the city when the	party	catches fire and rioting breaks out .

2579	party	3	Similarly ,  the de facto  existence of the protestant enclave in the North and its pursuit of protestant dominance in that state may have even reinforced a similar ,  though integralist ,  approach in the South .

2580	party	3	With independence the Irish Free State developed a type of political party organization on modern lines ,  but without the genuinely class - based politics one finds in other European countries .  The party structure followed was based on the Irish civil war antagonism of 19223 ,  with the pro - Treaty party more or less in power until the anti - Treaty party entered politics in 1930 .  However , both sides developed a centralized	party	line .

2581	party	3	The majority of the Roman catholic remnant in the North still believe in a united Ireland .  They demonstrate this partially by their support for the two nationalist parties ,  Sinn Fein and the Social Democratic and Labour Party ,  though support for the latter does not necessarily imply nationalism .  Despite the official socialist tendencies of these two	parties	, a substantial number of their voters do not appear to question the maintenance of a capitalist - type class structure in a new Ireland . The Workers '  Party still fails to command many votes in elections north or south of the border .  The provisional movement is divided on the issue of capitalism but ,  for  the time at least ,  has an openly declared policy of achieving an island - wide socialist republic by the combined means of violence and the democratic process .

2582	party	3	The Workers '  Party still fails to command many votes in elections north or south of the border .  The provisional movement is divided on the issue of capitalism but ,  for  the time at least ,  has an openly declared policy of achieving an island - wide socialist republic by the combined means of violence and the democratic process .  The SDLP , still the main	party	of catholic nationalists in Ulster , has dropped much of its socialist platform and maintains a delicate balance between nationalism and pragmatism in its politics . Despite frequently heard voices to the contrary ,  total catholic  nationalist domination would be the likely outcome of a united Ireland unless a confederal structure were implemented .  This is partly because of the structure of catholic nationalism in the Southern state and partly because the national unity sought by significant numbers of Northern catholic nationalists is still on the basis of the reversal of protestant  loyalist hegemony rather than a power compromise .	None
2583	party	3	But none of these groupings ever came near to threatening the dominance of Unionist Party organization ,  much less the solidarity of protestant loyalists ,  which always appeared total on the issue of incorporation into a united ,  independent Ireland .  It was only with the Troubles ,  from 1968 ,  that unionists  broke ranks .  Yet , despite the splintering , they have succeeded in allying the present two main	parties	against the Anglo - Irish agreement of 1985 . The Alliance Party of Northern Ireland ,  formed at the time of the abolition of the Stormont parliament ,  represents those catholics ,  protestants ,  and others who disavow the twin alliance of Ireland but retain at least a practical attitude on sovereignty .  They prefer British to Irish rule and seem unlikely to move from that position .	None
2584	party	3	The Alliance Party of Northern Ireland ,  formed at the time of the abolition of the Stormont parliament ,  represents those catholics ,  protestants ,  and others who disavow the twin alliance of Ireland but retain at least a practical attitude on sovereignty .  They prefer British to Irish rule and seem unlikely to move from that position .  While the	party	contains many who actively seek peace and reconciliation , it would be wrong to think of them in any sense as overcoming the basic conflictual components of bloc power in Ireland . Castle catholics ,  those who found a place in the Stormont administration and developed a stake in the union ,  have also voted alliance ,  but are probably now ,  in 1989 ,  switching their allegiance to the newly found conservative associations ,  which are seeking to bring British party loyalties to Ulster .  The Northern Ireland statelet was founded on an alliance between the protestant loyalists of Ulster and British imperial and capital interests ,  particularly as represented by the conservative party .	None
2585	party	3	It also set up its own scouting organizations ,  clubs both sporting and social ,  with Irish music ,  Irish dancing ,  and Irish or Gaelic games .  These games were and still are much loathed by the majority within the Northern protestant community .  Priests continued to act as sponsors of the local catholic nationalist political structure , chairing meetings of the	party	and permitting the political use of the parish hall . The parish structure and school became the heart of the Northern catholic  nationalist community ,  rendering culture ,  politics ,  and religious identity as interchangeable for members of the in - group .  Employment patterns ,  which followed the routes of enforced segregation in favour of protestants  for they controlled the greater part of the job market and especially the major industrial enterprises and the entire government sector of civil servants and police  were even reinforced by the system of job references provided by the parish priests and catholic notables .	None
2586	party	3	Conditioned by church canon law ,  participation by clerics in politics was forbidden .  But at the same time ,  an enormous sense of responsibility to protect the church ,  the family ,  and the minds and hearts of the faithful from incursions by the state was perceived to be the basic duty of the church leaders .  The leadership of the state knew in large measure what was wanted : it was part of the national popular consciousness as well as being itself a result of the convention between church and Irish parliamentary	party	in the previous century . What had been convention became part of the natural ,  common - sense universe of catholic  nationalist ideology .  No real consultation would have been necessary on that score .	None
2587	party	3	We aim to show in Chapter 5 that this blindness was in part promoted by the religious elements in their beliefs .  Secondly ,  there is the problem of the Northern catholic community ,  which tends to be taken as a monolithic nationalist community .  Apart from the fact that there has been significant support for the alliance	party	over the last dozen years or so among the catholic middle classes , there is also a further factor . Rose 's   ( 1971 )  survey ,  conducted in 1968 on the verge of the Troubles ,  found that as many as 30 per cent of the catholic population were explicitly prepared to endorse the constitution of Northern Ireland ,  which then included the Stormont parliament .  Catholics ,  however ,  did not vote for the Unionist Party.	None
2588	party	3	This indicates an acceptance of the state structures ,  or a recognition of a need for the separation of Northern Ireland from the remaining state structure of Ireland ,  but at the same time a continuing opposition to protestant  loyalist dominance .  One can also add that there is something in the present policies of the SDLP which suggest a need to maintain a somewhat fragile unity in respect of the national question .  Seamus Mallon , MP of the SDLP may have seen the Hillsborough agreement of 1985 as a step towards a united Ireland , but some of his co - politicians in the	party	would not share that view . Perhaps one should note the care with which the present leader of the party ,  John Hume ,  chooses his words over the future of the North .  He is careful not to promote the theme of reunification ,  but talks of discovering a new way ,  setting up structures of co - operation in the North between the two Northern Communities ,  with the support of the Southern government .	None
2589	party	5	The truth of the matter probably lies somewhere in between .  As Miller argues ,  there is a long tradition among the protestants of Ulster of viewing the British state ambiguously .  It is clear that in the past many of them have considered loyalty to be a two - way process , a contract or covenant , and that the state could be a traitorous	party	as well as the people . The tradition proved of crucial importance in forming the basis for the strategy of the alliance from 1911 until British recognition of their separate political claim in 1914 .  If the tradition still exists today  and it appears that it very much does so  it implies that the United Kingdom does not have for many loyalists a natural character of statehood in the way the Southern state has for catholic nationalists .	None
2590	party	3	Though the republicans lost the war ,  they eventually won their case with their successful introduction of the republican constitution of 1937 .  This shows the extent to which the republican ideal gained ground once independence was in place ,  furthering the ideological divide between protestant loyalism and catholic nationalism .  Despite this development , the struggle between the two previously warring factions has continued , the original republicans developing a populist , nationalist	party	developing a concern with law and order , and moderation on the national question . But the fight did not prevent the fundamental beliefs in the nation and the historic integrity of the island of Ireland ,  as nationalist parties described it in their New Ireland Forum  ( 1983  4 :  i .  28 )  ,  from remaining basic to the perceptions of both parties .  The Gaelic - Irish Component	None

Despite this development ,  the struggle between the two previously warring factions has continued ,  the original republicans developing a populist ,  nationalist party ,  and the former treaty party developing a concern with law and order ,  and moderation on the national question .  But the fight did not prevent the fundamental beliefs in the nation and the historic integrity of the island of Ireland , as nationalist	parties	. The Gaelic - Irish Component From the early years of the Southern state ,  cultural nationalism was deliberately developed by government means .	None
2592	party	3	From 1911 to 1914 ,  the Irish high clergy made successive attacks on the trade union movement and on socialism .  Rumpf and Hepburn  ( 1977 )  view the activity of the church during this period as quite decisive in limiting the appeal of socialism for the Irish subordinate classes until the 1950s .  The emergence of a new pro - capitalist	party	in the South from the end of 1985 , the Progressive Democratic Party , might show the extent to which political divisions based on the treaty and within the nationalist component of hegemony may have become problematic , to be partially replaced by an even more explicit concern with increasing the popular wealth and prosperity . Indeed ,  in the Irish general election of 1987 ,  progressive democrats took 14 seats ,  and 11.8 per cent of the total vote ,  which is sizeable for a young political party .  The decline of the labour element in the SDLP in the North ,  however ,  does indicate a trend to the style of politics in the Republic ,  that is towards the suppression of class politics and identity in line with the dominant ideology of the alliance .

2593	party	3	The decline of the labour element in the SDLP in the North ,  however ,  does indicate a trend to the style of politics in the Republic ,  that is towards the suppression of class politics and identity in line with the dominant ideology of the alliance .  The national question as such still remains a central preoccupation for catholic nationalists .  Because the nation is seen as only partially liberated , and particularly by the membership of the largest	party	Fianna Fil , the animus of the national - popular consciousness is focused on this issue , to the detriment of class - based politics . There has ,  therefore ,  been little chance in the past for a political growth of class consciousness among subordinate groups .  What socialism there has been among the catholic  nationalist tradition has always tended to be allied to republicanism ,  especially in the period 1913 to 1930  ( Rumpf and Hepburn 1977 :  13 )  .	None
2594	party	3	The dual source of the state 's  role in hegemony helps us understand the limitations of the state in respect of the alliance whose power it also represents .  This is why collections by the provisionals in public houses were having partial success in the  1970s without too much interference by the Garda ,  the Republic 's  police force .  The collections indicated a wider hidden culture of support for the lads who were at the forefront of the battle to restore national unity , in addition to the much smaller	party	political support they enjoyed in the South . The Roman catholic church ,  in episcopal statements ,  unequivocally condemns violence North or South .  As seen in Chapter 3 ,  this was also true in the nineteenth century ,  despite lower clergy support particularly for the Fenian movement .	None
2595	party	5	There can be no doubt that the lack of such a programme bore heavily upon the poor ,  and that poor health and mortalities were a consequence .  In 1946 there were already signs of clerical opposition to any socialization of welfare in queries about Fianna Fil 's  proposals from Archbishop McQuaid and the Confederation of Convent Schools .  As has already been seen , it was the style of both church and politicians to avoid their mutual consultations being known , which tells us that the secularity of the state at that time was partially a faade , but one which it was felt by both interested	parties	had to be maintained , probably so as not to confuse the faithful . In a letter to the Irish premier in 1947 ,  while an extensive health bill was going through parliament ,  the bishops pointed out that to claim such powers for the public authority ,  without qualification ,  is entirely and directly contrary to Catholic teaching on the rights of the family ,  the Church in education ,  the rights of the medical profession and voluntary institutions  (  Irish Independent  ,  12 Apr. 1951 ,  quoted Whyte 1980 :  143 )  .  It appeared that one of the main sources of the bishops '  opposition was the authoritarian nature of the legislation .	None
2596	party	3	The next significant event of constitutional relevance was the important initiative taken by the nationalist parties in Ireland in 19834 ,  the New Ireland Forum .  This was an initiative sponsored by the SDLP at first intended to bring together politicians from both catholic  nationalist and protestant  loyalist groups to discuss the future of the island as a whole .  In reality only the major nationalist	parties	participated . Loyalist parties refused to join in ,  and the Provisional Sinn Fein was excluded by the fact that the ground rules for the forum only allowed parties accepting constitutional ,  nonviolent politics to participate .  The forum completed its consultations and reported in the Summer of 1984 .	None
2597	party	3	The new Ireland must be a society within which ,  subject only to public order ,  all cultural ,  political and religious beliefs can be freely expressed and practised .  This was made explicit in terms of the sense of British identity which protestant loyalists experience :  This implies in particular ,  in respect of Northern protestants ,  that the civil and religious liberties that they uphold and enjoy will be fully protected and their sense of Britishness accommodated  ( New Ireland Forum 19834 :  i .  223 )  .  For the very first time , the leadership of all the major constitutional nationalist	parties	in Ireland , representing 90 per cent of the nationalist population , had abandoned the concept of the tyranny of the majority will . The people of Ireland were not identified as the catholic  nationalist population .  There were still traces of ethnocentrism in the nationalist viewpoint elsewhere in the report :  for instance ,  they still referred to the historic integrity  of Ireland  ( New Ireland Forum 19834 :  i .  28 )  ,  implying an almost naturalistic concept of Irish unity ,  when as a political unit Ireland only ever existed as a British - administered territory .	None
2598	party	3	Fianna Fil appeared to be equally divided on the issue .  The new progressive democrats came out in favour of the referendum proposal on 14 May .  Of the smaller	parties	, the Workers ' Party was the most decisive in favouring the change . Other public bodies who actively campaigned on behalf of the constitutional amendment were the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties .  The presbyterian and methodist churches in Ireland ,  along with the Church of Ireland ,  welcomed the proposal .	None
2599	party	5	Divorce was seen to be harder on the women than the men ,  who could get out of their family  responsibilities so much more easily with divorce than without it .  In opposing the arguments marshalled by the anti - divorce groups ,  the pro - divorce group argued that ,  despite the existence of divorce legislation in Northern Ireland ,  there was still a low divorce rate .  The period of separation in undefended cases was two years , and five years had to run if one of the	parties	opposed the divorce . That men in particular do not benefit from the procedures was suggested by the fact that twice as many women as men filed for divorce .  It was argued that the pattern in other countries was that laws permitting divorce followed social trends in the numbers of marriage breakdowns rather than vice versa and that the fears of societal breakdown promoted by opponents in Ireland were unfounded in fact .	None
2600	party	3	Further criticism came from Roman catholics in Britain .  An editorial in the Catholic Herald and Standard  on 25 May  it is distributed in Ireland as The Standard   criticized the Irish bishops '  apparently  low esteem of their laity 's  ability to remain constant in their marriages .  Also a call from the Alliance Party in the North was made by John Cushnahan ,	party	leader . He found it ironic that anyone who supported the Anglo - Irish Agreement could oppose a modest measure to introduce divorce  (  Irish Times  ,  28 June 1986 )  .  Perhaps an important counter to the archbishop of Dublin 's  interventions was the well - known lay liberal catholic and Head of Information at RTE ,  Louis McRedmond .	None
2601	party	5	the failure has continued for a period of ,  or periods amounting to ,  at least five years ,  iii .  there is no reasonable possibility of reconciliation between the	parties	to the marriage , and iv .  any other condition prescribed by law has been complied with ,	None
2602	party	3	The bishops were successful in urging the Irish party to accept the church 's  programme for Irish education as a whole .  Their success was founded on a dual strategy .  On the one hand they subscribed to the annual Irish parliamentary	party	as the true political representatives of the Irish people and its interests in the British parliament . Even a Castle bishop such as Archbishop Healy ,  now announced his conversion to the nationalist cause .  In other words ,  support for the education policies of the church were the quid  the Irish party had to give in order to obtain the quo  of the bishops '  endorsement of the party as the genuine political representatives of the Irish people or nation .	None
2603	party	3	On the one hand they subscribed to the annual Irish parliamentary party fund and ,  on the other ,  they publicly praised the Irish party as the true political representatives of the Irish people and its interests in the British parliament .  Even a Castle bishop such as Archbishop Healy ,  now announced his conversion to the nationalist cause .  In other words , support for the education policies of the church were the quid the Irish	party	as the genuine political representatives of the Irish people or nation . The agreement over education was so clear that when the first revolutionary Irish government set itself up in 1918 ,  prior to negotiated independence ,  there was no Minister for Education .  And when the Irish Free State did emerge in 1921 ,  practically the entire school system was under the control of the churches .	None
2604	party	3	The burden of the message was that good catholic parents sent their children to catholic schools .  The curate added to this that those promoting the integrated project were in fact promoting secularism .  The fact that a prominent member of the current community council and an integrated education supporter was a member of official Sinn Fein , the Workers '	party	has always been suspected to be an anti - clerical and secularist force . In residents '  association meetings ,  the clergy 's  point of view received vocal support from one or two members of the older village community which preceded the housing estate .  The total of those favouring denominational schooling in the initial survey was less than one - third .	None
2605	party	5	Mr Murray now wants to give away the Smugglers '  Kitchen so that he can channel his efforts into another property  the Dartmoor Inn at Bovey Tracey ,  also in Devon .

2606	party	4	She broke off ,  and Sven Hjerson felt her body slump again in his arms .  But by the time he had gathered up her handbag and Lord Woodleigh 's  camera ,  which had come to rest nearby ,  she was able slowly to make her way with them to the nearest point where the accident could be reported .  Some two hours later the whole	party	sat , exhausted and silent , in deckchairs on the terrace of Sven Hjerson 's hotel , sipping half - heartedly at cups of abominable tea and looking without seeing anything at the wide sweep of the Bay of Naples spread out far below them . Jilly Jonathan was pale but had calmed down after the bout of hysterical weeping that had overcome her once they had got her to the hotel .  Peter Horbury sat beside her ,  still looking tousled from his exertions among the rocks .	None

They stared at one another in dismay , the sad , small wickedness of their friends and neighbours strewn around their minds like dirty confetti from a	party	long past . Henry Phipps had been the chief celebrant at this particular form of get - together ,  and now someone had brought his priapic revels to a rather spectacular end .  Constable Arthur Perkins was a phlegmatic man ,  resigned long ago to losing his hair and his prospects for promotion as he worked out his years in an area singularly free of serious crime .	None
2610	party	1	I would n't wear muddy hunting boots if I was going to climb in through a bedroom window and murder a lady ,  said Ethel .

By the time he got home his wife was already beginning to be unwell .  I see .	None
2612	party	1	She was a somewhat intense woman who probably rather enjoyed such gatherings ,  but I 've often wondered if she secretly used them as a ruse to get her husband home to mind the little one while she nipped out for a breather .   Anyway ,  I digress .  After Paul left , the	party	broke up quickly , as though everyone felt that the business of the day had now been concluded . I ,  in my role as hostess ,  lingered to the end and soon there was only Anne and myself left .  Did you get The Times Educational Supplement  this week   she asked me .	None
2613	party	2	I was in cinema -  and theatre - land  the part of London that never sleeps .  Through the cafe window I watched London nightlife pass by .

2618	party	4	No one had thought to specify how many shirt buttons could be undone and fear was now patently manifest that some uncontrollable disorder would be let loose should more than one button be opened to reveal chest hair ,  or even a medallion .  Underlying the disquiet was a strong current of belief that the act of going tieless was tantamount to social chaos !  Four years later , as I mentioned above , I was	party	to the same fear at Bramshill , in relation to the use of the Nato sweater . One of my colleagues ,  no doubt swayed by the heat of the discussion ,  turned on me sitting in my short - sleeved uniform shirt ,  and rebuked me with the warning that in my force ,  you 'd be disciplined for mutilating police property .  Initially I was puzzled ,  until I realized he thought I had cut off my shirt sleeves ,  for in his force  ( noted for its disciplined enforcement of a correct uniform presentation )  ,  all uniform shirts had long sleeves .

2625	party	4	But here a thin frieze of very old trees had been preserved for the delectation of the lairds who looked out from their houses on the slopes  Cluny ,  Grandtully ,  Clochfoldich ,  Pitcastle .  At two of the gates on the roads up to thy houses dogs had been stationed ,  chained to posts newly hammered in .  The animals barked themselves hoarse as the little	party	tramped past and they were amused to see men watching them , one from behind a ruined byre , another behind a thick tree - trunk .

Among many high - level tasks ,  he drafted an Appeal to the League of Nations on minority rights ,  and made many approaches to various government authorities through a wide range of memoranda ,  petitions and similar appeals .  He was asked to stand for parliament , but declined , having no particular relish for	party	- politics ; he was too large - hearted a man for that . For all his organisational and business efficiency ,  he was a man of immense personal charm and dignity :  Well - dressed ,  aristocratic ,  calm ,  and with a ready and reassuring smile ,  it was said .  Moreover he was a man of great devotion ,  who upheld the high ideals of the synagogue 's   pulpit ,  the beauty of its services ,  as well as the splendour of the building itself .	None

Their natural rebelliousness achieved its heights now ,  not least in their violation of the traditional rules ,  their attempts to undermine the institution by radical policies ,  their attempts to breach the system .  They invited people whose backgrounds were very different to join this high class Jewish fraternity , and tried to run it as a continuous	party	. They even instituted a rule of drinking in front of the Fraternity House ,  for which Leonard was impeached !

Although no formal proposals have yet been announced by anyone ,  there is no doubt that the idea for a Super Super Series ,  as I suppose it should be called ,  is gaining momentum .  The problem , of course , would be reaching agreement with all	parties	concerned , as to which events , other than the four Grand Slams , would be included . One theory is there should be Sydney ,  a week earlier than at present ,  leading into the Australian Open ,  the Stella Artois Championships as the traditional prelude to Wimbledon ,  plus Cincinnati and Indianapolis on the way into the U.S. Open .  Rather more controversial would be deciding which tournament should take pride of place in the European clay court season leading into Paris .	None

Fizzy keg beer it may be ,  but that is no reason to dismiss it out of hand without considering its appeal as a true classic beer .  With the strength of CAMRA as a consumer movement ,  I welcome the return of the Party Seven into the off - sales world ,  which is one of the largest sections of the industry ,  as the large breweries are forcing the 2 pint upon tenant landlords and others ,  and people turn elsewhere to seek their alcoholic enjoyment .

2648	party	4	The hostel even had its own fleet of camels on its regular Hillaby - style treks ,  used them to carry supplies or provide a mount for weary walkers .  It sounded an ideal way to explore some of the remoter parts of this region ,  but our time was limited and we wanted to move on to the higher mountains .

2649	party	4	Instead of accompanying us ,  he carried the Bulgarian bodily down to the refuge .  Three down ,  five to go .  In truth , a guide was n't really necessary for our	party	that good - weather day . The route was obvious ,  we were all experienced and we were not exactly alone .  But it was still comforting to have with us little Liena ,  our 19 - year - old interpreter who was a very competent rock climber and all - round mountaineer ,  for she had climbed Elbrus in the past and could give assurance that we were on the right course .	None
2650	party	4	She held the lead and quietly plodded upward through the crisp snow that covered the long Baskan Glacier .  In a way ,  climbing Elbrus is a bit like climbing Mont Blanc ,  for you 'll seldom be alone .  So I was particularly pleased to find at one point , when I 'd indulged in a lengthy photo session , that the rest of the	party	had gone over the brow and out of sight and I was left for a while with the world to myself . It was a world of pristine beauty and breathless calm  all the wind was beyond the ridge  and I revelled in it .  On and upward ,  slow now with the altitude telling on legs and lungs alike ,  the route was measured in numbers of steps before a rest was needed .	None

2652	party	4	We turned and descended slowly to the tracks we had made on the ascent earlier that morning ,  then sloughed our way down. Twenty minutes later we met our guide ,  seated in the snow making radio contact with the hut .  Having delivered the injured Bulgarian to safety we had then returned to the ascent , hoping to catch our	party	. He and Liena conversed for a while before he announced his decision to wait there for the return of Tony and Ferdy  ( the Germans )  ,  and Dave the American ,  asking me to take care of Liena on the way down. It was a magnificent descent .	None
2653	party	1	Holiday camps or bothies   Over the last five years the bothies have become something of an open invitation for exploitation .  They are now regularly used by groups of people involved in Outward Bound activities and school	parties	. Visiting certain bothies in the Affric and Dundonnel areas during 1989 ,  I was amazed to find things regulated by a dinner gong !  On Skye during the summer of 1990 ,  I visited a bothy not far from the Cuillins to find certain people staying two weeks  ( fishing )  ,  one week  ( canoeing )  and no room at the inn for overnighters .

2665	party	3	A very young man has shot himself and we ride off in an inquisitive Gadarene cavalcade  ( our ladies had never seen a suicide )  to view the corpse ;  everything 's  so boring  recall Marya Lebyadkin 's  words  one ca n't afford to be squeamish about one 's  amusements so long as they are fun ;  and Lyamshin ,  the man who gets himself asked to parties to mimic women in labour ,  new - born babies ,  and peasants in the confessional ,  steals a bunch of grapes from the room of death .  It 's  not easy to say what the narrating I is doing at such a scene .  Again and again he seems to be in and yet dubiously of the	party	. In fact the chronicle succeeds in having its cake and eating it ,  all the way back to the stir caused by Nicholas Stavrogin 's  arrival in our town ,  when it is recorded among other things that he seemed to know a lot  But of course it did n't take much knowledge to astonish us .  Isolated ,  that looks like straightforward double focus :  the first - person narrator inside the chronicle box ,  unaware of his provincial limitations ;  and Dostoevsky outside it .	None
2666	party	1	In The House of the Dead  he makes us feel that the grim actualities of prison life do this job for  him. The Possessed  works differently .  We have already met Lyamshin , the member of the quintet whose	party	act is to mimic women in labour and new - born babies . Flanking him as it were is the wife of another familiar figure and quintet member ,  Virginsky .

2668	party	5	However ,  he has never stated that this was in fact the case .  I would also state my belief that in relation to Class AA ,  our parent company has behaved entirely properly ;  the process of applying for a patent necessarily entails wide publication and ample opportunity for opposition .  I willingly accept that an inventor cannot scrutinise every patent application ; by the same token a manufacturer cannot contact all potentially interested	parties	. My view about the Matsushita response is simply that the Japanese higher education system generally requires knowledge of English ,  which seems at odds with the Technics explanation .  The basic variation in the Technics circuit  arrangement has necessitated a set - up procedure ,  not present in my circuit .	None
2669	party	5	All I can say to the objectors in both categories is that those who do not see a problem do not have a problem ,  and they can happily ignore what I have written .

Not wanting to seem too negative , I have outlined ways in which the discipline of English as currently constituted might divide , to the benefit of both	parties	. But knowing how the academic mind works ,  I am not optimistic about change .

2672	party	5	YESTERDAY was the last day for comments from the public on a paper issued in January entitled :  Comparability of Financial Statements published by the International Accounting Standards Committee .  This is hardly the sort of catchy title guaranteed to get most of us rushing to our desks in search of pen and paper ,  nor is it easy to imagine squeezing into packed village halls to listen to speeches demanding a rewrite of the rules on deferred taxation .  In acknowledgement of this , IASC , which comprises the leading world accounting bodies , sent out a separate invitation to interested	parties	asking for their views on the subject . It called this :  Towards the International Harmonisation of Financial Statements .  Harmonising international accounting standards is more important than one might think .	None
2673	party	3	Moreover ,  Mr Kinnock brushed aside the suggestion that he needed a big idea or unique selling point to challenge the appeal of Thatcherism .  He went on to say that there was nothing at all from the last decade for which he could give Mrs Thatcher credit .  The latter point was silly , coming from a man who has spent much of the last five years persuading his	party	that the world had changed since May 1979 and that there was no going back . The former is debatable .  Mr Kinnock is a relatively recent convert to revisionism .	None
2674	party	3	Rulers do not set the moral climate of their nations except ,  perhaps ,  at the extremes .  Hitler and Stalin debauched the moral climates of Germany and Russia respectively .

2675	party	3	As he prepares his text ,  he might recall Harold Wilson 's  speech to the 1963 Scarborough conference .  After 12 years in power ,  the Tories had run out of steam .  Wilson 's task was to project his	party	as an alternative government and associate Labour with the agenda of the 1960s . He succeeded triumphantly .  His white heat speech not only demonstrated that he was aware of the scientific revolution that was changing Britain but also associated Labour with efficiency ,  modernisation and planning .	None

But the Tories still have time to recover ,  especially if they jettison some of the more unattractive aspects of Thatcherism .

2679	party	3	Here Mr Kinnock should set out clearly why ,  in the Gorbachev era ,  negotiated rather than unilateral disarmament is almost always preferable .  On the economy ,  there is still work to do .  Polls show that , despite impressive performances by John Smith and Gordon Brown , many voters still believe Labour is a	party	of high taxation and inflation . But there is strong support for sensible increases in public spending ,  provided this does not lead to massive hikes in taxation .  The party has to emphasise that ,  in contrast to the Tories ,  it believes public spending should rise in line with growth in output ,  but that it will pursue responsible fiscal policies .	None

He should repeat his assurance that , while Labour is opposed to the privatisation of water and electricity and wants to see a return to public control , it is not the	party	's intention to clobber those who buy shares . Muddle over trades union legislation must also be cleared up. UK employees ,  among the least protected in Europe ,  need more extensive statutory rights .	None
2682	party	3	I am disappointed the policy review has adopted such a negative attitude both to a Bill of Rights and electoral reform .  A new agenda ,  centred on citizens '  rights and democratic reform ,  selective government intervention ,  environmental protection and a more positive role in Europe would provide the basis for a new progressive majority .  It must be Mr Kinnock 's task this week to capture this new agenda for Labour and set the	party	on the path to power . Disturbingly quiet on the Western front By WILLIAM REES - MOGG	None
2683	party	3	The official blurb explains that the plaster figures stand as if boldly forging ahead ,  their eyes fixed on our motherland 's  beautiful future .  Perhaps unwittingly ,  the new statue hints at a deeper truth underpinning the hardline triumph :  the worker ,  the peasant and the intellectual gaze wistfully towards the Forbidden City ,  the grandest monument to the genius of Chinese civilisation ,  but the soldier has his eyes fixed in a different direction  down the Avenue of Eternal Peace towards Zhongnanhai ,  the walled compound where party leaders live and work .  For as Mao decreed , if power grows from the barrel of a gun , it is the	party	that must control , and if necessary use , that gun . Four months after the People 's  Liberation Army stormed central Peking with the loss of hundreds of lives ,  few can have any doubt about the party 's  determination to enforce this Maoist maxim .  As many as 100,000 soldiers are still encamped around Peking .	None
2684	party	3	But if they are physically weak ,  the old guard remain politically strong .  Refighting the battles of their own youth ,  they have tried to fix China 's  eyes firmly on the past .  The	party	may claim to be in the vanguard of history , but its clock seems to have stopped in the 1950s . Propaganda campaigns ,  class struggle ,  the cult of the model worker and even the almost evangelical rhetoric of the cold war are all back with a vengeance .  Television and newspapers no longer praise model entrepreneurs but heroic labourers such as Zhang Fuxin ,  praised for throwing himself into a pit of polluted mud to retrieve a piece of equipment .

Standing exactly where Mao Tse - tung proclaimed the People 's Republic of China on 1 October 1949 , paramount leader Deng Xiaoping joined other	party	leaders atop the Gate of Heavenly Peace to preside over a night of fireworks and martial music in Tiananmen Square . Fearful of protests or violence by citizens outraged by the army 's  brutal assault on Tiananmen on 4 June ,  armed troops cordoned off a large area of central Peking ,  admitting only hand - picked spectators into the square .

In the sweetness of victory ,  Mr Andreotti 's  Roman cohorts have forgotten that they are mortal and ,  in the eyes of many churchmen ,  their greed and arrogance now risk bringing Catholic politics into disrepute .  The Pope 's Vicar of Rome , Cardinal Ugo Poletti , has taken to scolding the Christian Democrats for their divisions which may bring victory for the secular	parties	and the Communists in city elections on 29 October . A public rift in Catholic politics surfaced last week when the Communion and Liberation movement severed its ties with a powerful weekly magazine ,  Il Sabato ,  run by Andreotti supporters .  The magazine exploited popular Catholic themes ,  such as anti - abortion campaigning and family values to channel middle - class resentment into a political movement .	None
2691	party	3	Tixier - Vignancour 's  success in retricting General Salan 's  punishment to life imprisonment in 1968 so angered President de Gaulle that he considered resignation .  By then Tixier had taken his anti - Gaullist crusade to the point of running himself as a presidential candidate .  Without any proper	party	organisation he fought a brilliant campaign in 1965 , canvassing the French throughout August on every beach from Dunkirk to Menton . He was eliminated in the first round ,  coming fourth behind de Gaulle ,  Mitterrand and Jean Lecanuet .  He promptly consigned his five per cent of the vote to Mr Mitterrand in the second round ,  a gift whch the Socialist candidate happily accepted .	None
2692	party	5	In many of them ,  particularly criminal cases ,  the interests of the client may be quite different from those of the public .  In these cases the interests of justice may demand special requirements such as ,  for example ,  that the preparation and presentation of the case be in separate and independent hands .  In the second category , general civil cases ,	parties	should be able to choose their own lawyers because the interests of justice would be inherently less likely to fetter the client 's right of choice . Lord Donaldson implied ,  however ,  that solicitors who exercised their new rights of audience in these cases ought to be expected to concentrate on advocacy .  While emphasising that he had not reached any firm conclusions ,  Lord Donaldson 's  voice will be a powerful one in behind - the - scenes manoeuvres as rules governing the exercise of the new advocacy rights are hammered out away from the parliamentary battlefield .

2701	party	3	It is hypocritical that we praise Gorbachev and perestroika ,  praise what is happening in Poland and Hungary ,  when we ca n't even amend basic policy .  A second composite instructing the National Executive Committee to treat conference resolutions as amendments to review documents was defeated by 3,704,000 to 2,245,000 .  Moving it , Ken Slater , of Hyndburn , pointed out there were some 60 resolutions on the conference agenda endorsing existing	party	policy for unilateral nuclear disarmament . But if the review document ,  Britain in the World ,  was adopted those would be ignored .  Florrie North ,  of Eltham ,  said ,  after 53 years as a party member ,  that it seems conference is being asked to rubber stamp policies made elsewhere .	None

Florrie North , of Eltham , said , after 53 years as a	party	member , that it seems conference is being asked to rubber stamp policies made elsewhere . Martin Smith ,  of Brighton Kemptown ,  protested :  We want a Labour government ,  but that does not mean to say that we are going to meekly accept inadequate policies and an economic policy that is doomed to failure .  Mr Whitty told delegates the NEC had given them adequate time to look at the reviews .	None
2703	party	3	The GMB general union and the Amalgamated Engineering Union ,  with 800,000 and 600,000 votes respectively ,  are casting theirs against .  The decisions of the union delegations will probably mean a continuing wrangle .  A hardline motion calling for black sections is almost certain to be thrown out on Friday and the	party	could be left without a policy as support for a proposition calling for societies with exclusively black members is also in doubt . Mr Kinnock 's  compromise would have created one society ,  with a national executive seat if it attracted more then 3,000 members .  The NEC adopted the plan by 21 votes to five .	None
2704	party	3	Mr Kinnock and his deputy ,  Roy Hattersley ,  have consistently opposed exclusively black sections .  The party 's  campaign to win mass membership has failed ,  the GMB leader ,  conceded yesterday .  John Edmonds , a confidant of Neil Kinnock , said the	party	needed to talk to potential members rather than rely on advertisements and mail shots . His union will spend 1.5m over the next two years in an attempt to increase individual membership .  Membership dropped by 23,000 last year to 265,000 ,  although officials say additional members attracted this year has almost offset that loss .	None
2705	party	3	The Labour Party Conference :  Left rejects appeals for unity By JOHN PIENAAR PROMINENT left - wingers yesterday rebuffed appeals for unity behind Labour 's policy review and accused the	party	leadership of a calculated effort to stifle grassroot dissent . Tony Benn ,  Ken Livingstone and Dennis Skinner ,  Labour chairman ,  joined in an attempt to rally opposition to the review at a pre - conference fringe meeting .  As Labour leaders predicted a smooth ride for the policy overhaul this week ,  the three hard left national executive committee members attacked the main elements of the package ,  from its abandonment of nuclear unilateralism to the shift away from all out renationalisation .

As Labour leaders predicted a smooth ride for the policy overhaul this week ,  the three hard left national executive committee members attacked the main elements of the package ,  from its abandonment of nuclear unilateralism to the shift away from all out renationalisation .  Mr Benn told the Campaign for Labour Party Democracy rally : Now we have a leadership that claims the right to control the	party	entirely from the top . They aim to win by detaching the Labour Party as a whole .  He cited the decision to deny local activists the chance to amend the review ,  the leadership 's  refusal to restore all trade union immunities ,  the rejection of demands for all - black sections within the party and the strengthening of Shadow Cabinet power .

2708	party	3	And the party chairman derided the differences between Neil Kinnock and Bryan Gould ,  the trade and industry spokesman ,  on the value of water industry shares .  Let 's  tell them we are going to take them back without compensation .  He added : The whole balance of the	party	is being moved away from the conference and the NEC to the Shadow Cabinet . Mr Livingstone urged Labour activists to strengthen the left wing faction in the NEC elections .  The Labour Party Conference :  Skinner cheered over water shares	None
2709	party	3	By JUDY JONES DENNIS SKINNER ,  the Labour Party chairman ,  won loud cheers from conference delegates yesterday when he demanded the return of water to public ownership without compensation to shareholders by the next Labour government .  He also urged the	party	not to turn its back on traditional principles and values in its drive to agree an election - winning package of policies this week . In a speech that blended music - hall style with soap - box rhetoric ,  the veteran left wing MP for Bolsover ,  said :  For too long the Labour Party has been trying to follow in the wake of Mrs Thatcher 's  agenda .  We have to escape from the time warp in which ,  unfortunately ,  some people are still caught after three election defeats in a row .	None
2710	party	3	We have to escape from the time warp in which ,  unfortunately ,  some people are still caught after three election defeats in a row .  Mr Skinner insisted :  There will always be a need for socialism ,  whether in Britain or anywhere else ,  so long as there are millionaires living in the lap of luxury and other people living in cardboard boxes ,  so long as we have a system which allows the poor countries of the world to hand over 50m to the rich .  He maintained there was only one way to resolve differences within the	party	leadership over Labour 's policy towards a privatised water industry : Take water back without compensation . However ,  Mr Skinner firmly supported Neil Kinnock 's  rejection of electoral pacts with other parties to help to defeat the Tories .  He portrayed the Tories as the party of worn - out ideas ,  led by a Cabinet of incompetents .	None

2713	party	4	But Dr Runcie 's  ideas of a limited primacy  recognising the Pope as a central figure in the Christian Church ,  who would exercise a primacy for the sake of unity and mission  have been rejected as insufficient by the Pope .  They have also aroused Protestant anger against Dr Runcie ,  at the same time as he has become involved in a row over his attack on the Pharisees of British society .  Though Dr Runcie and his	party	could not take Holy Communion at the papal mass , he had earlier celebrated the eucharist at the Anglican church in Rome after three demonstrators rose from the congregation as he ascended the pulpit ; the visit has been dogged by protests from supporters of the Rev Ian Paisley . In his sermon ,  Dr Runcie said :  We should ever recognise the scandal that Anglicans and Roman Catholics must celebrate two eucharists to make one memorial of our redemption on the day of our Lord .  Dr Runcie has gone out of his way on this visit to concede many of the doctrinal points and practices which large elements of the Church of England have traditionally found offensive in Roman Catholicism .	None
2714	party	3	Although the policy review will be endorsed by the conference ,  giving Neil Kinnock the freedom to go on to the offensive against the Conservatives in the run - up to the next general election ,  there are a number of areas of potential conflict .  Calls for consideration of electoral reform and a new form of black representation are both expected to be defeated .  Ron Todd , the general secretary of the transport workers ' union , said that today 's vote on the multilaterist nuclear defence policy would not yield the massive and overwhelming majority predicted by right - wingers , and he warned that	party	leaders could not expect everybody to goose - step in the same direction once the policy had been carried . The conference opened with Labour buoyed by a series of weekend opinion polls giving leads of from 5 to 12 points .  Soviet Union faces serious energy shortage	None
2715	party	1	As the new presenter ,  Nicholas Witchell is chiefly celebrated for sitting on a lesbian during a news bulletin ,  you switched on at dawn with some cynicism .  It was soon clear ,  however ,  that this was broadsheet television .  Witchell would be doing his	party	trick only in special circumstances . The programme pretty well began with an interview with someone from the Bundesbank which ,  as running orders go ,  is a bit like a long - jumper beginning his approach with his laces tied .  In fact ,  almost everything before seven is business news with men in suits watching over the pound like doctors :  And the latest news from Tokyo  it seems to be a little better .	None
2716	party	3	A quote away from glory By PETER JENKINS BRIGHTON : In six verbose years as leader of his	party	, Neil Kinnock has not a memorable phrase to his credit . Although not exactly stuck for words ,  nothing that he has said has yet entered the language .  His speechwriting aides confessed themselves stumped for a Kinnockism worthy of inclusion in a dictionary of modern political quotations .	None
2717	party	3	His speechwriting aides confessed themselves stumped for a Kinnockism worthy of inclusion in a dictionary of modern political quotations .  The best they could recall was his one - liner to Derek Hatton ,  the Liverpool militant ,  at Bournemouth in 1985 :  You do n't play politics with people 's  jobs ,  Mr Kinnock told him. But that falls into the somewhat different category of intra -	party	polemic . I am talking about phrases which speak to the country by capturing its mood or its hopes .  Harold Wilson 's  words are remembered today ,  25 years after he led Labour back to power ,  from 13 wilderness years .	None

The	party	may have put on a collar and tie but it is still the Labour Party , prone to its old reflexes ( as it reminded us yesterday on defence spending ) , prisoner still of its anachronistic structure , its mind set in 100 years of working - class history .

Here was the Labour Party reverting to its old self ,  a better self ,  yes ,  than the monster it became under the demonic spell of Tony Benn ;  here was a party responsive once more to its own people ,  the people it so shamefully betrayed at two successive general elections since 1979 ,  but a party  as somebody once said of the SDP  -  promising a better yesterday .

The abandonment yesterday of unilateral nuclear disarmament  ( although not the intention of abandoning Britain 's  nuclear deterrent at the earliest opportunity while other countries keep theirs )  was done in the same spirit of moralism which had gone into the banning of the Bomb .  Once more the world was treated as a convenience wrapping for Labour 's  parochial and predominantly internal preoccupations .	None
2722	party	3	Much determination and hard work have gone into that attempt ,  but it is now seen to have failed .  Without reforms ,  failure will become more complete .  Yet if the GDR were to become a multi -	party	democracy , it would lose its identifying ideology and become a pallid shadow of the Federal Republic : less grossly consumerist , perhaps , but also less desirable . In Bonn it is hoped that there can be orderly change across the border ,  soon enough to convince more East Germans that life is worth living there .  Perhaps because to think about reform is to think about its purposes ,  Mr Honecker and his colleagues keep their minds closed to such challenges .	None
2723	party	3	We naturally welcome Labour 's  existing promise to repeal Section 28 and to legislate against discrimination in the workplace .  And few would disagree that ,  given the fanaticism and sheer ferocity of tabloid prejudice ,  it would be unreasonable for gay people to expect that Labour should adopt our cause as an election issue .  However , the watering down of a basic and principled commitment , within Labour or any other libertarian	party	, especially in response to intimidation by newspapers of such a spurious morality , could prove deeply discrediting . It is with regard to this principle ,  but more importantly to the actual facts of persecution ,  that we urge the support of Labour 's  leaders and membership by restoring ,  this week ,  a policy commitment to full equality for lesbians and gay men .

2742	party	3	The change has been striking in two areas ,  with women 's  issues and environmental concerns thrust to the head of the party agenda .  There has been an influx of women into the party ,  accompanied by a decision to have equal representation at all levels of the party by the mid - 1990s .  And the	party	has been devising an environmentally - friendly economic strategy . Its central theme is to make polluters pay ,  starting with a proposed 30 per cent rise in the price of petrol .  We are getting away from the labour party for industrial workers ,  says Walter Momper ,  the SPD mayor of Berlin and one of the new generation of leaders .	None
2743	party	3	It has not always been easy for those working class voters who see the Greens as an undisciplined bunch ,  inimical to the interests of industrial society ,  to keep up with the SPD 's  enthusiastic appetite for environmental matters .  There has been a noticeable shift of working class support from the SPD to the far - right Republicans  not as much as the losses from the Christian Democrats ,  but enough to worry party managers .  The differences in our electorate are much bigger than for the conservative parties , says Heidi Wieczorek - Zeul , a member of the	party	praesidium .

2745	party	3	Oskar Lafontaine ,  the SPD leader in the Saarland ,  has argued vociferously that a modern mass party like the SPD could not afford to have its policies confined to the narrow interests of employed industrial workers .  In the party 's  new programme ,  the trade unions have had to backtrack on their central demand ,  now accepting that a shorter working week will mean reduced wages .  But Mr Lafontaine , standard - bearer of the up - and - coming generation , and the second most important figure after Mr Vogel on the committee drafting the	party	programme for the next decade , has certainly not had things all his own way . His attempts to link reductions in working hours to more flexible work practices ,  for example ,  have run into powerful union resistance .  The SPD 's  candidate for Chancellor seems to be narrowing to a choice between Mr Vogel and Mr Lafontaine ,  between a cautious compromiser and an erratic reformer .	None
2746	party	3	The party is far from sure which message it wants to send to voters ,  and is likely to leave the choice until the last minute .  Neither of these two men can control with any certainty ,  however ,  the factor that will perhaps exert the most influence on the SPD 's  election chances .  Whether the	party	likes it or not , its fortunes are hostage to the still youthful coalitions in Frankfurt and Berlin , and their notoriously unpredictable Green allies . If these coalitions fall apart ,  as an earlier version did in Hesse in 1987 amid much rancour ,  the repercussions could be disastrous ,  with the Christian Democrats poised to exploit any hint of red - green chaos .  If we are not successful in Berlin ,  then the chances of a red - green coaliion in Bonn are gone for five to ten years ,  says Walter Momper .	None
2747	party	3	Despite his lack of political experience ,  Clouthier 's  20 - year leadership of business organisations stood him in good stead .  After the banks '  nationalisation he sold most of his interests in the dozen or so companies he had created and drawn his wealth from ,  and committed himself to combating the existing political system .  He quickly established himself within the PAN , challenging its professional politicians with the support of his business colleagues and unifying the fractious	party	. He took conservative ideas on privatisation and land reform ,  gave them a populist anti - government bent and managed to woo over many poorer voters  -  especially in northern Mexico  who previously feared that the PAN represented only business interests .  He promised to demystify the all - powerful presidency and make it more accountable to congress and the voter .	None
2748	party	3	He was popular as a man of the people who toured Mexico with his wife and 10 children in a mobile home during the presidential campaign ,  a very different strategy from the typically aloof approach of the PAN 's  other wealthy and middle - class leaders .  His blustery manner brought out large crowds despite frequent government attempts to intimidate rural populations into staying away .

The	party	leaders show no sign of relenting . Extending Labour 's  front into Ulster ,  they say ,  would run counter to the policy of reunification of Ireland by consent .  There is also a suspicion in some circles that the campaign is to some extent driven by a form of closet unionism ;  a motive the Belfast campaigners attribute freely to their Tory counterparts .

Indeed , Mr Kinnock called for a modest celebration at Labour 's recovery : it was an encouragement , an inspiration to see the	party	working together once more , he said .

How did he do   Not badly at all , given the immense difficulty of restoring credibility to Labour as a	party	of government . Mr Kinnock staggers under the additional handicap of having no ministerial experience which would equip him for the supreme office to which he aspires .  He is the child of Labour 's  crisis which resulted in his ideological credentials being preferred to the experience and qualifications of his rivals .	None

The most successful feature of his speech was his recruitment of the future to Labour 's  cause .  All elections in two -	party	parliamentary systems are essentially about whether or not it is time for a change . Yesterday Mr Kinnock presented a picture of a world changing so rapidly around the present government that the Prime Minister had become out of touch ,  out of date and out of step with the British people .

It is ridiculous that somebody should talk to a	party	who should be heading it , he said in an interview with The Independent . He was replying to demands that he should resign to pave the way for talks between the Pakistan - based mujahedin resistance and Kabul 's  ruling Peoples Democratic Party  ( PDPA )  on a peace settlement .

In 1966 , however , when Mao began his dramatic bid for absolute power , using young Red Guards to discredit and persecute his old rivals within the	party	, Chen again rose to the occasion , acting as a mouthpiece for Mao 's increasingly scrambled thoughts and policies .

Underlining last weekend 's  commitment by John Smith ,  the shadow Chancellor ,  to control spending ,  Giles Radice ,  MP for Durham North ,  told the conference that properly financed public spending was not only good economics ,  but good politics .  Voters had to be certain Labour 's  programmes were properly costed .	None
2796	party	3	But if members of Labour 's  Philosophical Tendency ,  from Tony Benn to Bryan Gould ,  are choosing their words carefully it may be through fear of how they will look in each other 's  diaries .  Weary constituency and trade union delegates ,  queuing for a cup of tea and a sandwich ,  constantly risk ending up with a signed copy of someone 's  memoirs .  Around the Brighton Conference Centre , academic tracts on the	party	's past and future course seem to proliferate daily . To a fevered imagination ,  it seems no one can turn a corner in the crowded conference complex without running into a mug shot of one or other high - theoretician leering pensively from a wall of hardback dust covers .  Their debate on Labour 's  plight rages far above the brawling oratory in the conference hall .	None

2802	party	1	As this date did not come within ITV 's  planned winter programme of Sunday afternoon games a new date was proposed ,  December 22 ,  a Friday night with a kick - off at 8.05 ,  prime - time viewing guaranteed to capture a huge audience in holiday mood .  Neither club was pleased ,  supporters were furious and Liverpool were reported to have protested strongly .  There was much concern expressed on Merseyside about the safety aspects of a match kicking off that late in the evening on the day when all the tradtional pre - Christmas	parties	are held in offices and factories . In the past it has taken great efforts by the Merseyside and Greater Manchester police to keep supporters apart in what is widely thought to be the most intense antagonism in the League .

2803	party	3	By ANTHONY BEVINS ,  Political Editor NEIL KINNOCK yesterday set investment in education and training as his top priority :  the commanding height to be scaled by the next Labour government .  In his address to the	party	conference at Brighton , Mr Kinnock said Labour was now ready , eager and able to take power from the Conservatives at the next election , and his confidence won him one of the most prolonged and enthusiastic ovations received by a Labour leader for many years . His attack on the Conservative government ,  given added impact by passages of scathing wit ,  also included an analysis of Margaret Thatcher 's  out - of - touch ,  out - of - date foreign policy .  Identifying her attitude to the emerging democracies of the Soviet bloc ,  disarmament ,  South Africa ,  the environment ,  Third World debt ,  and the EC ,  Mr Kinnock said :  Margaret Thatcher shows that she 's  from the Greta Garbo school of diplomacy .	None
2804	party	3	I want to be alone .  That 's  the constant theme .  Colleagues said last night that the speech marked a change of gear as Mr Kinnock moved away from	party	organisation and policy and accelerated into the election campaign . Lord Callaghan ,  the last Labour prime minister ,  said :  What happened in the 1980s was a temporary aberration from what has always been the real position of the Labour Party ,  and Neil Kinnock has recaptured the traditional position .  But Mr Kinnock stressed in his speech that given the inevitable and unprecedented mess which would be left behind by Mrs Thatcher ,  a Labour government would have to set  and unflinchingly stick to  four basic priorities .	None
2805	party	3	Warning that there was no single mechanism which would catapult Britain to economic strength ,  Mr Kinnock said :  Research and development ,  transport and communications ,  science ,  education and training ;  they are the priorities .  They are the productive base of our economy .  They were prerequisites an unparalleled priority for dealing with inflation , the balance of payments deficit , unemployment , and funding the	party	's policies for social justice . Having delivered his tough message ,  Mr Kinnock turned to prime targets of the Conservative record  topped off with high interest rates ,  which he likened to a policy of assassination for mortgage - holders .  Even if the Conservatives took the brakes off in the run - up to the next election ,  people would not be deceived .	None
2806	performance	2	Is it criticism    There is a massive amount of writing about art ,  only some of which can immediately be identified by a reader as criticism .  Writing by the art critic of a newspaper is self - evidently criticism , in parallel with the writing of music and theatre critics ; an exhibition can be treated almost in the same way as a	performance	. Articles in magazines are less certainly described as criticism ,  for their main topics may be personalities or history ,  and art may be only a small part of the writers '  account .  Books and catalogues may contain criticism ;  but their writers may think of themselves as art historians ,  philosophers ,  aestheticians ,  anthropologists ,  historians or biographers ,  and there are many other possibilities ;  their books may never be identified as art criticism .	None
2807	performance	4	Let us walk with a visitor through the city ,  a veteran of the Second World War who values it as one which was almost unscathed from the bombing which devastated so many European cities .  He starts at a medieval Gothic window ,  a remnant of the first university in central Europe  ( founded 1348 )  ;  he pauses at the rebuilt Bethlehem Chapel ,  the site of where the Mass was first allowed in Czech ,  and Jan Hus preached before being burnt for heresy in 1413 ;  he pays respects to the relics of the Jewish quarter with its ancient and crowded graveyard ;  to cross the river he uses the Charles Bridge ,  lined with Baroque statues  ( many between 1700 and 1720 )  ,  and climbs the hill to the Castle where art and architecture of all periods again further embellish the golden city of central Europe .  In the evening our friend has supper in the art nouveau interior of the Hotel Europe , before going to a	performance	at the National Theatre , built in the 1880s as a monument to the Czech national spirit , pinioned under the Austro - Hungarian Empire . As he has enjoyed his day ,  he sleeps soundly without a nightmare about what was specifically Czechoslovak in the sights .  The truth is that nationality in art has limited importance .	None
2808	performance	4	Historians can point to the philosophical views which underlay this ambition ,  and artists and sculptors were in various ways affected by the demonstration of its realisation in the theatre built for the composer at Bayreuth .  The collaboration of artists with the stage was also brought to a high point by Serge Diaghilev ,  in his commissions to artists for the Russian Ballet .  This connection between painting and the theatre was important to earlier European art in religious as well as secular	performances	. Critics no less than artists have wide interests in the arts ,  and may introduce comparisons in their interpretations .  In the nineteenth century to say that a picture was poetic was a common term of praise .	None
2809	performance	2	Clearly artists working in several media have a wide range of references .  The art critic is thus bound to consider with care what standards of comparison should be used .  In the late twentieth century artists working in	performance	pose difficulties for the critic , though some observers find it refreshing rather than troublesome to consider work beyond the easel picture and the individual sculpture . In sum ,  then ,  the monograph is a major site for art critical writing ,  and ,  moreover ,  the place where the most extended criticism is likely to appear .  The reader may be disappointed by the standard of what is written ,  but unlike other sites of criticism ,  this cannot be attributed to the form of publication ,  only to the limitations of the author .	None
2810	performance	4	But if Roth dissents from the statement ,  then imagining how he came to write most of his books becomes a problem .  Zuckerman tells his Maria :  Being Zuckerman is one long	performance	and the very opposite of what is thought of as being oneself . In fact ,  those who most seem to be themselves appear to me people impersonating what they think they might like to be ,  believe they ought to be ,  or wish to be taken to be by whoever is setting standards .  So in earnest are they that they do n't even recognise that being in earnest is the act  .	None
2811	performance	2	The man upstairs ,  the first husband whom Maria is to leave ,  is not self - aware  unlike Zuckerman ,  who declares ,  on behalf of the self - aware ,  that he has no self and that the self is a joke .  But Roth must know that it is likely to be no joke to those who are reading his book .  Zuckerman says here that	performance	is all there is , that person and persona are one . But we may feel on reading this that it takes two to perform  that performance requires ,  in however regressive or circular a fashion ,  the self that so many people believe they have ,  and that this epistolary Zuckerman exhibits here ,  in a display of inadvertence which may or may not implicate Philip Roth .  This is a self which there may be no way of proving .	None

2813	performance	2	When we turn to the theatre the question of scale is also significant .  The theatre is larger than life ,  not in terms of physical scale ,  but because movements and speech are comparatively emphatic and intense ,  even when a play simulates everyday natural surroundings .  Some people find this makes theatre less believable less true to their own experience and therefore less convincing than the more restrained	performances	seen on television and cinema . Theatre invites you to give your full attention to what is happening on stage  the theatrical experience is a very concentrated one and you as a member of the audience are vitally connected to what is going on .  As part of the audience you are as much a part of the entertainment as the performance itself ,  and this is something that dramatists are aware of and have always written for .	None

As part of the audience you are as much a part of the entertainment as the	performance	itself , and this is something that dramatists are aware of and have always written for . Sometimes you will be directly addressed by the characters  this is something which happened a great deal in Greek and Elizabethan theatre  ( for example ,  look at the speech by Chorus in Act 4 ,  scene 1 of Henry V  ,  which draws the audience into the atmosphere before a battle enormously effectively )  .  It is also used as a dramatic device by many contemporary playwrights .	None
2815	performance	2	So ,  what can you learn from looking so closely at the actor on stage ,  TV and cinema   In the first place you will start to think about how an actor 's  work differs according to the demands of the medium .  And you will become aware of technical skills noticing economy of effect and style , seeing and hearing how an actor interprets a script , and how his thinking comes across in a	performance	. Of course ,  if an actor is doing his/her work well ,  you will have to work really hard to notice all these things  for the effect will be seamless .  Reading	None
2816	performance	2	But you may not actually learn  much ,  simply because the main object of the group will not be to help you but to get on and do the play ,  relying on the skills available and hoping that the audience will give adequate support .  So what else can you do   In recent years the amateur actor has had more opportunity for classes in theatre work , including voice and movement training as well as	performance	and directing skills . These facilities differ in all parts of the world ,  but in Britain the evening class is probably the most accessible form of training .  London is obviously where most of the opportunities abound .	None
2817	performance	2	But when you are looking for a suitable speech you ca n't really reject anything familiar solely because you think it might bore the panel .  It 's  true that extracts such as Phoebe 's  Think not that I love him from As You Like It   ( Act 3 ,  Scene 5 )  or Viola 's  1 left no ring with her from Twelfth Night   ( Act 2 ,  Scene 2 )  may be all too well known to a panel ,  but I cannot agree with an adjudication policy that would ban these pieces from the audition .  The selection is right if it truly works for the competing student , and it is the quality and force of the imagination that will carry off the	performance	of the piece . The most important thing is your firm knowledge that the selection is within your present range .  It 's  not much use arriving somewhere at ten in the morning clutching the collected works under your arm and wishing you had a wig and been born thirty years earlier in order to play Lear  or for that matter the Duke of Gloucester .	None
2818	performance	2	What you will eventually be working towards is a fusion of instinct and technique ,  and training is very largely to do with improving technical skills .  At drama school ,  there is constant attention to a student 's  control of both voice and movement ,  and the different departments work at developing a student 's  overall acting technique .  The emphasis will be on developing an actor 's mental and physical concentration , and giving him/her sufficient craftsmanship to sustain a	performance	. Classes The first term is always an unsettling time ,  and it generally takes a few weeks before students become familiar with each other ,  and work together effectively .	None
2819	performance	2	Most classes last for an hour or perhaps an hour and a half .  In the first term ,  rehearsals for the production project will usually be around two hours in length ,  but progressively more time will be spent on this aspect of the course as the student advances .  Ideally the classes support the work done on the production project and it is particularly valuable if there is strong liaison between voice and movement tutors with the director of a project not least in helping students see how the instructional classes connect with their own	performances	. If drama schools do not incorporate a stage management course ,  basic lectures and some participation in production work may take place in the senior terms .  It is always useful for a student of acting to have some practical knowledge of stage management ,  helping him/her to appreciate the need for efficient technical support for any production .	None
2820	performance	2	And a trained singing voice is undoubtedly a valued asset  there may well be some competition for a place on singing tutorials .  The first production The text for the first term 's production will usually be selected for the purpose of getting a new group to work together rather than trying to go for detailed individual	performances	. The range is obviously very wide ,  and you may find yourself in a Greek tragedy ,  or even a modern exercise play such as Games  by James Saunders ,  where the student may add to the text by research material which can be incorporated in the project .  Either way ,  the main intention will be to establish a way of working ,  and to begin assessing students '  voice and movement abilities .	None
2821	performance	2	The piece tests the actor 's  awareness and imagination to the full ,  but nevertheless makes precise demands on him :  he must follow exactly what the author says .  Throughout drama school there will be continuous work on acting solo pieces ,  and both singing and acting tutorials are usually conducted on a one to one basis  ( more on tutorials in chapter 7 )  .  Of course the student also needs to learn how to co - ordinate dialogue with all of the necessary actions and movements which are part of the natural traffic of	performance	, and learn about prop handling . Classes help the actor to gain confidence in dealing with many things happening at the same time ,  and this is an important part of student work .  Radio ,  television and film classes	None
2822	performance	4	Unfortunately ,  it is often difficult to get agents to attend these productions .  Most drama schools final productions are staged over a similar sort of  schedule ,  which means agents are asked to see students '  work over a fairly compressed period .  Agents are notified of	performances	. Remember ,  though ,  that badgering agents is quite useless ;  if they want to come they will come ,  but telephoning them and overselling yourself can be just as useless as not letting them know that you 're alive and working .  It will be the same story for many moons to come .	None

And of course holding together a part like Juliet with long gaps between the performance nights and no real rehearsal in between is difficult to do  that can be rather hairy .  Sometimes you 're a week away from the last performance you gave and then find yourself out there  so that the voice and understanding of the part does need constant refreshing .	None

I mean the most exciting moment of all is when you are actually chosen for a part  after that initial excitement it 's  a bit downhill  not because the work is n't marvellous but because the first challenge is the peak .  I think everyone needs the director to be vitally interested in the work well beyond the first week of actual	performance	. In the West End there seems at the moment a tendency to rely too much on the goodwill of actors which is often accompanied by a failure to maintain a true interest in what is going on for the actor .  Perhaps directors in particular need to realise how much their vitality means to the continuing performance  that it is n't enough to be left up on a stage merely doing it night after night .	None

2832	performance	5	The conversation continues after delivery ,  with training for the staff who are to use the system ,  and support services while the system is in use .  Technology suppliers to the British hotel and restaurant industry say that their products are often under - exploited ,  because too little thought has been given to what the systems are supposed to achieve and too low a priority is given to staff training .  One industry spokesman comments : The overall	performance	of computerised management systems within the hotel industry relates more to the attitudes of managers towards training and the commitment of their suppliers than it does to the superiority of the individual systems . Two contentious issues are the cost of training to managers and the same managers '  grasp of systems  ( or the lack of it )  .  It is claimed that catering colleges have failed to get to grips with the developments of technology ,  acknowledge its importance and provide students with a level of understanding based on the industry 's  needs .

Over the summer I did read a few books and tentatively prepare a few classes , but it was indisputably a pretty lacklustre	performance	on my part . I had managed to convince myself that ,  after a lifetime of teaching at university level ,  this was all going to be painfully easy .

2841	performance	5	Favourable soil conditions affect a plant 's  chances of survival beneath trees .  Very often the soil is dry and hungry  ( deficient in nutrients )  ,  especially near evergreens and vigorously rooting hedge species such as privet .  Working quantities of organic material into the top few inches will markedly improve some plants '	performance	. Massed conifers cast dense shadows and their fallen needles can upset the acid/alkaline balance of the soil .

2842	performance	5	Clearly while we do have gliders that spin ,  it is vital to give pilots enough experience to recognise what is happening and to make the right moves instead of panicking and doing nothing .  The effects of rain on the stall Many pilots are unaware of the significance of dirty wing surfaces and of rain or drizzle on both the	performance	and the stalling characteristics of gliders . Tests show that on most high performance machines ,  a spread of splattered flies on the leading edges can account for up to a quarter of the glider 's  performance ,  reducing a glide ratio of 40 : 1 to less than 35 : 1 and making a mockery of glide calculations .  This is so serious that for world championship flying ,  many gliders are now fitted with a means of cleaning off the leading edges of the wings in flight .	None
2843	performance	5	The effects of rain on the stall Many pilots are unaware of the significance of dirty wing surfaces and of rain or drizzle on both the performance and the stalling characteristics of gliders .

This is so serious that for world championship flying ,  many gliders are now fitted with a means of cleaning off the leading edges of the wings in flight .  In light rain I have measured an increase of about 8 knots in the speed for the pre - stall buffet and stall of a K13 ,  although the stall itself did not seem to have changed in character .	None
2844	performance	5	After a launch failure of any kind above two or three hundred feet ,  once the speed has been checked ,  it is best to turn off 90 or so in order to avoid going further from the field .  In this position ,  the glider is on a base leg for any available field upwind and it is easy to look back and decide whether returning to the field is practical .  On a normal tow , except for very low	performance	machines , the climbing angle of the towplane and glider is much steeper than the glider 's gliding angle when flying downwind . So ,  in theory ,  the glider should be within easy reach of the gliding site .  However ,  in turbulent and windy conditions it is always better to play safe and land into wind in another field ,  rather than to make a downwind landing .	None
2845	performance	5	It is alarming to hear how many relatively inexperienced pilots seem completely unaware of the risks they take when pitting their skills against the forces of nature .  They often think that if their flying is good enough ,  it is safe for them to press on in any weather conditions .  The	performance	of modern gliders makes it much easier and more likely for a pilot to fly himself into a potential death trap unless he uses his imagination or has already learned to have a healthy respect for the elements . The result has been a noticeable increase in the number of pilots who suddenly find themselves faced with a situation far beyond their control ,  usually a situation that they had not even considered at the start of the flight .  In most respects ,  using wave lift is far safer than cloud flying for attempts at Gold and Diamond heights .	None

If they then fail to meet these increased demands ,  distressing confrontations may result .  The point I am trying to make from all this is that to win a karate bout needs two things your ability to defeat the opponent and the referee panel 's ability to recognise your superior	performance	. The first requirement is in your hands ,  the second is not.

Curiously ,  his lowest mark was in English Literature  ( a mere 57 per cent )  ,  though in Composition he achieved 69 per cent .  His	performance	was better in French , where he obtained 71 per cent and 75 per cent in the grammatical and oral examinations respectively . Physics realised 67 per cent ;  History a promising 77 per cent ;  and Mathematics was strongest of all ,  with an average of 77 per cent over three subjects :  algebra I and II at 72 per cent and 80 per cent ,  geometry at 86 per cent and trigonometry at 70 per cent ;   ( he admitted to us that he had opted for the latter at school ,  because it enabled him to evade Latin !  )  .

At any rate , they are the best marks that were to appear on his	performance	schedule over the next four years , when his average ran at 56.4 per cent . In his own beloved English ,  it was always higher ,  averaging 71.3 per cent in the three years he offered the  subject ;  French ,  which was only offered in his first year produced a convincing 75 per cent ;  and Economics ,  offered in two years ,  62 per cent .  Philosophy ,  at 70 per cent ,  was significant ;  but he barely squeezed by in Latin ,  taking a refusal at his second attempt and attaining a mere pass at the repeat stage  ( thanks ,  no doubt ,  to his past opting out ,  which necessitated his taking Latin from scratch at university )  .

2857	performance	1	A minority of them never went to B at all ,  but went straight to A and searched ,  like the others ,  at a visibly empty space .  Until about eighteen months or so they will typically be unable to search for objects which have been displaced invisibly  ( by transposing containers ,  for example )  .  We need fine - grain theories of why the	performance	breaks down , theories about memory development ( a sophisticated memory - failure account is still in the running ) , about the ability to inhibit actions , about the development of the frontal cortex . But from the perspective of constructivism  which is a general theory of how cognisance is possible and how it develops  the immediate information - processing shortcomings that lead to the failure to relate one 's  actions to objects is not relevant .  That  infants fail to search in these situations  although they clearly have the motor skills to do so  is one of the empirical bolsters to the view that what develops  is the ability to relate actions to experiences of them  ( again :  whatever of means in this context !  )  .

2861	performance	1	The vast bulk of the neuropsychological work performed in the United States to investigate cognitive processes uses group studies as in ,  for example ,  the investigation of human amnesia  ( severe loss of long - term memory function as a result of brain damage )  .  A set of amnesics is first assembled on the basis of their low scores on a clinical memory test .  Their	performance	on some task is then evaluated by comparing their average score with the average score of a group of matched control subjects . The purpose is to test an hypothesis about what the cause of amnesia might be .  This approach to amnesia has had some success .	None
2862	performance	1	In one memorable instance ,  a patient pronounced LISTEN as LISTON and responded that 's  the famous boxer  ( Marshall and Newcombe ,  1973 )  .  Despite their problems with irregular words ,  however ,  these patients can produce a plausible pronunciation of unfamiliar non - words  ( blasp ,  for example )  .  What might be responsible for such an unusual pattern of	performance	 This impairment can be explained in a straightforward manner if one assumes that damage has occurred to the part of the reading system that involves addressed  phonology .  This would mean that the patient is heavily reliant on assembled phonology  .	None
2863	performance	1	In cases of phonological dyslexia ,  the patient finds it almost impossible to read any word with which he or she was unfamiliar prior to brain injury .  However they can still read a very high percentage of pre - morbidly familiar words accurately ,  regardless of their spelling .  This pattern of	performance	suggests that these patients find it difficult to assemble a pronunciation , but they can continue to read familiar words because the lexical system , utilizing addressed phonology , is still working effectively . This means that they are able to retrieve the appropriate pronunciation of a word as a whole from the speech output lexicon .  The dual - route model of reading is thus able not only to explain an existing set of data within a simple theoretical model ,  it also successfully pinpointed the existence of an entirely new type of acquired dyslexia .

2864	performance	3	What they want in future is 32 seeds in all the Grand Slam tournaments instead of the 16 they have at present .  Their argument is that it is good for the tournament ,  a s well as the players concerned ,  if as many as possible of the higher ranked competitors survive the early rounds .  They also claim that the players have earned this protection by the	performances	in the rest of the year which have brought about their rankings . In my view ,  to have 32 seeds ,  even in the men 's  singles where there is far greater depth of talent than among the women ,  cannot possibly be justified .  To have 32 seeds in a 128 women 's  singles draw ,  would be nothing less than a protection racket .	None

2870	performance	5	In the 1970s there were only two types of potential replacement DMU being considered by BR 's  passenger marketing people and the engineers .  The Class 210 diesel - electric design of three - car or four - car unit had actually been produced to a business specification developed in conjunction with the board 's  passenger commercial managers .  It was intended as a high -	performance	set which could inherit the reliability associated with previous BR ( SR ) DEMUs , thus beating the older , inherently unreliable diesel - mechanical multiple units hands down. Its problem ,  when analysed by the new Provincial sector was its price :  it would cost too much to enable a financial case to be made for the 210 breed to replace existing DMUs even taking asbestos removal into account .  The other design in the offing was the two - axle railbus which had started life as a Research Division project aimed at combining high - speed freightvehicle technology with that of the standard Leyland road bus in order to produce a low cost diesel train .	None
2871	performance	3	But the new two - axle units were actually responsible for part of the upsurge in traffic on their routes and were certainly no worse than the buses with which they were successfully competing .  Meanwhile ,  however ,  it had become clear that there had to be a replacement DMU which was placed midway in size and cost between the railbuses and the 210 units .  But , if underfloor engines and transmissions were to be used , they had to be in a different league of reliability and	performance	from the DMUs which BR had been running since the 1950s . Fortunately ,  some experience had been building up on the European continent ,  in Holland in particular ,  with DMUs which had very reliable and  cost - effective engines and transmissions .  The Nederlands Railways 3100 and 3200 Class units employ Cummins diesel engines with Voith hydraulic transmission driving through permanently engaged final drives on the axles .	None
2872	performance	1	There have even been attempts to stage biographies ,  one of the first being Loring 's  Billy the Kid   ( see page 30 )  .  Choreographers who are inspired to interpret music can do so in many ways ,  all of which can be successful ,  but only if they remember that its overall rhythm is not merely a mechanical guide to the timing of the steps within the dance design  ( see page 68 )  .  The second meaning of the word impetus should be applied to the actual	performance	of any step or pose in the purely technical sense . That is ,  the choreographer must understand from which part of the body impetus is to be given so that the step achieves its full purpose at the proper moment  usually in some gesture and its musical emphasis .  The moment can be as the dancer pauses momentarily in a pose ,  as a comma in the middle or as a full stop at the end of a sentence .	None
2873	performance	1	Or the moment can be an important point in an overall design to fill space ,  such as the moment in a grand jet en avant  when the dancer 's  two legs are at an equal height from the ground and he or she appears to travel onwards effortlessly through space .  It can also be the moment when a dancer moves into a pirouette  and spins before holding a pose .  However , more important is the third meaning of impetus which has also to do with physical	performance	. Impetus is again needed ,  particularly in a story ballet ,  when it has to be given to emphasise the significance of a step .  This always used to happen in older ballets when the hero would take a step forward with a slight stamp before he swore to marry the heroine .	None
2874	performance	2	Sometimes it is valuable to emphasise the impetus itself ,  particularly if a bravura pirouette  is needed to display a dancer 's  particular expertise or perhaps some exhibitionist trait in the character portrayed .  This can be most effective in cases where the dancer takes a slow preparation into a firm but slight demi - pli  then suddenly rises  and turns five or six times .  This kind of bravura	performance	is only legitimate if the context and music allow the dancer to steal a little time . Most classical choreographers still use this device when working with nineteenth - century ballet music ,  which was often written to order by a composer understanding the choreographer 's  desire to show off a dancer .  Since the days of Diaghilev and his commissioning of scores exclusive to one ballet from such composers as Stravinsky ,  this pandering to technical prowess has rarely happened .	None
2875	performance	4	The above definition may at first seem to have little to do with a choreographer 's  work .  But if the choreographer does not understand all the details which go to make the total presentation of a ballet ,  it can all too easily fail in some way or other. Merely to count all the details that it is necessary to accumulate from the preparation of a scenario and score through rehearsal to public	performance	should make it clear that co - operation from other artists as well as from dancers is required . There must be a librettist  if the choreographer does not plan out the plot  a composer or arranger of music ,  a designer for set and costumes and all those associated with sets and props ,  painting stage - managing ,  lighting and everything else needed to get the curtain up. An understanding of mass in choreographic terms only means how to organise and manipulate the dancers within that mass of objects .	None
2876	performance	2	In every enchanement  each step an/or pose must be given its appropriate value by way of beginning ,  climax and end so that its place is justified by its importance to the whole sentence .  This does not mean that today 's  choreographers need follow the conventions laid down by the Renaissance scholars who were more interested in the physical ability and behaviour of courtiers .  They were not creative artists but they were and still remain for the most part arbiters of technique and the niceties of perfect	performance	. The originality of so much of   Ashton 's  and MacMillan 's  choreography fur classical ballets lies in the way they follow the basic principles and rules in order to create an infinite variety of enchanements  from the traditional vocabulary of steps ,  and yet discard the conventions .  Birthday Offering  Ashton 's  technical virtuosity  ( The Royal Ballet )	None
2877	performance	4	So explicit are the tiny gestures and the perfect timing of exits and entrances that the audience is forced to recognise the personal tragedy of a love that spoke no words .  Although MacMillan 's  choreography fur both the above ballets is based on classical technique ,  it in no way conforms to the old school of dance or conventional mime .  To portray specific characters , whether imagined or real ( some were known to members of the audience at the first	performance	of Enigma Variations and Isadora ) , the would - be choreographer can use classical dance as a firm base but must pay more attention to his characters as particular individuals . They live and work in a more varied ,  often plebeian ,  environment than that of courtiers in the palace of a prince .  The latter ,  after all ,  was the stereotype setting fur all classical ballet until 1789 ,  the year of the french Revolution .	None
2878	performance	2	Petipa attempted this in The Daughter of Pharaoh  .  This type of choreography was taken up by later music - hall acts whose very eccentric soft shoe ,  sand dances before a background of pyramids and palm trees aroused much laughter .  However when Fokine staged A Night of Egypt ( later Cleopatra ) he went a great deal further and developed a more particular Eastern style inspired by the	performance	of some Siamese dancers . He started by sketching numerous frescoes and statuettes he found in the Hermitage Museum ,  Leningrad .  From such ideas he formed dances which did away with pointes  but retained much of the classical footwork which he co - ordinated with the less familiar action of the arms and hands .	None
2879	performance	2	Ashton and MacMillan do show that changes can be made .  To take only one example ,  their use of the arabesque  as a gesture .  Its style of	performance	and expression change repeatedly throughout each ballet as the dancer changes with the attendant circumstances . The arabesque  as a gesture changes to give some insight into the character 's  moods ,  emotions and actions ,  as well as arising out of the rhythmic and melodic phrasing of the music .  There is an obvious contrast in Ashton 's  Enigma Variations  between the youthful Dorabella 's  playful and loving arabesques  in front of Elgar and the arabesques  of his Wife ,  which are calm and tenderly sympathetic when she dances with him.	None
2880	performance	0	Nor has any of them had to respond so intensely to his wishes .  Yet the discipline of MacMillan 's  design in all its variety ,  dimension and structure requires each dancer to understand and conform to technical discipline .  It is this which makes the	performance	capable of repetition . A comparison of Rudolf 's  apparently undisciplined emotions with the subtle feelings expressed by Bratfisch ,  his valet ,  shows how MacMillan creates some relief even within the decadence and horror .  Natural emotional expression	None
2881	performance	4	She later shows her mettle as a clog dancer abetted by four pretty girls ,  tries to set her cap at Father Thomas ,  but finally realises she cannot frustrate true love and dances out happily with the rest .  This English pantomime tradition Ashton also exploited earlier in his choreography for the Ugly Sisters in Cinderella  where he followed the tradition that one is always a somewhat modest violet bossed about by her dragon of a sister .  This double characterisation was made more hilarious at the first	performances	when the bossy one was danced by Helpmann , and later the taller MacMillan , with wonderfully extended dvelopps , and the shyer one by Ashton with dainty attempts to be correct at all costs . A similar incongruous matching of the very tall girl with one of the shortest boys in MacMillan 's  Elite Syncopations  reveals that he ,  too ,  understands that old music - hall and pantomime practices are a wonderful source of inspiration if a British audience is to laugh and enjoy the occasion as the dancers do .  Another commedia dell'arte character whose play has influenced too few choreographers is that of Harlequin ,  a maker of mischief ,  a magicker of spells ,  an animal impersonator and always a great dancer .	None
2882	performance	4	Both Ashton and MacMillan take the technical aspects of their choreography very seriously .  They know that just one small slip can make a joke in dance .  Moreover , the dancers involved have to take this type of	performance	very seriously , even though they must be able to toss off the mistakes with an air of surprised innocence . Characters in National ballet The above approach towards any type of character role is a very typically English trait and has been used in music halls ,  pantomimes and comedies fur many years .	None
2883	performance	2	The great dancer Antonio was unable to match Massine 's  design even though each member of Antonio 's  company danced as to the manner born .  Antonio was a star dancer and he could not take an objective view of the whole .  His design focused on his brilliant	performance	of the various solos but otherwise filled the stage with authentic steps which played little part in making the action unfold .

One might not expect sawing a Renault 5 in half to constitute part of an electronics research project ,  but that 's  what they call it at sub - basement level ,  below the Strand .  The Renault 2.5 is part of Drivage , and EC - funded project intended to assess the	performance	of older drivers , and work out what technical advances might be useful to older age groups . The project has involved collaboration with the college geography department ,  and the traffic studies centre of the University of Groningen ,  in Holland .  The car is part of a driving simulator ,  which uses a Philips video disc player ,  in conjunction with an Acorn Archimedes A440 computer ,  to project video images onto a screen .	None
2895	performance	1	The research should help quantify the differences between older and younger drivers .  So far ,  150 have been tested ,  and the full statistical results will be available soon .  The research team 's David Fraser says that preliminary results indicate that the range of driving	performance	is age independent , far outstripping variations between groups . So next time you 're stuck in your car behind that little old lady 's  Austin 1100 ,  remember ,  statistically ,  she 's  probably no worse a driver than the 20 - year - old in the Porsche which is about to overtake you both .

2896	performance	5	Telephone 923 33837 .  Low - power frequency synthesizer A cmos high -	performance	frequency synthesizer , the UMF1009T from Philips is intended for use in channelled VHF/UHF equipment such as portable and mobile radio and is programmable via the standard two - line serial I2C bus . The main divider consists of a 7 - bit binary counter and two rate selectors to control the external programmable prescaler and the 7 - bit internal programmable divider  (  n2/n2+1  )  .  The total division ratio from the DIV input to the input to the phase detector  ( Fig.2 )  is N =  ( 128 .  n2 + nl )  *A + n0  ,  where n0 ,  n1 and n2 are less than 128 .	None
2897	performance	5	Also driving the phase detectors is the reference oscillator chain ,  which consists of a crystal oscillator with an external crystal resonating at up to 16.8MHz and a reference divider in two sections .  The first section is programmed to give an output at 1.2MHz and the second to produce 12.5kHz or 15kHz output to the phase detectors ,  a wide choice of frequency input thereby being possible .  Two phase detectors , analogue and digital , work together to produce good noise	performance	and fast locking . When lock is achieved ,  the digital detector is switched out of circuit to avoid noise denigration in the analogue circuit .

2898	performance	5	My view about the Matsushita response is simply that the Japanese higher education system generally requires knowledge of English ,  which seems at odds with the Technics explanation .  The basic variation in the Technics circuit  arrangement has necessitated a set - up procedure ,  not present in my circuit .  Furthermore , my own analysis of the Technics arrangement suggest that it is sensitive to loudspeaker impedance variations ; under some conditions the	performance	is worse with the subsidiary amplifier than it would be without it . At the same time ,  even when the circuit performs better at some loudspeaker impedances than the traditional Class B circuit ,  it still has worse performance than that of Class S because of the low ,  yet varying impedance seen by the main voltage amplifier for all loudspeaker impedances bar one .  Analysis	None

2900	performance	5	Moving - iron and reed types were produced in dozens of variants ,  in addition to the odd - ball kinds  like the compressed - air type ,  but the breakthrough came with the moving coil ,  which had been modernised from its Siemens 1874 patent and Lodge 's  1898 one by Rice and Kellogg in 1924 .  The fourth picture shows a magnificent affair made by Paul Voigt ,  which had twin diaphragms and 20kilogauss field magnets .  It was possibly the first time the BBC had had to take other equipment out of service because someone ( Voigt ) complained of its bad	performance	, which had shown up on this speaker . If proof were needed of the new - found fascination with sound reproduction in the 1950s ,  the last picture should supply it .  It is of one of the unforgettable demonstrations by G.A .	None

2902	performance	5	This must seem a promising start for RDS for which first receivers appeared only in 1987 .  Consumers wary of poor performance Broadcasters have been none too happy with	performance	of some of the earlier sets . Mark Saunders  ( BBC Radio )  in a personal review of design requirements for RDS car radios points out that one of the problems that RDS poses for both broadcaster and receiver manufacturer is that ,  with the exception of obvious features such as the display of the programme service name ,  an RDS receiver is not apparently different in performance ,  or looks ,  when observed in the static environment of the dealer 's  showroom .  So from the point of view of the consumer ,  there are few tests that can be done prior to purchase ,  to ascertain how well a product will perform when fitted into the car .	None
2903	performance	5	So from the point of view of the consumer ,  there are few tests that can be done prior to purchase ,  to ascertain how well a product will perform when fitted into the car .  He says that it is a sad fact that many early RDS receivers failed to perform even basic tasks adequately ,  and many people have been put off RDS for life because of :  experiences with receivers that performed inadequately and which failed to live up to the promises the broadcasters made for them .  Mr Saunders goes on to admit that broadcasters are not entirely blameless in this respect : More should no doubt have been done at an earlier stage in development of RDS to give the receiver manufacturing industry some guidelines setting out the minimum levels of RDS	performance	that should be achieved . His belief is that it is preferable if the RF tuner and RDS processing stages of the receiver are continuously active whenever the vehicle ignition is switched on .  The on/off switch on the front panel should only control the power amplifiers and display functions .	None
2904	performance	1	Admittedly ,  conditions in the American academy are a little tighter than they once were ,  but what looks like stringency by American standards is still lavishness by British ones .  Britain can never hope to compete with all this .  Nevertheless , professionalism on American lines is still the ideal that academic administrators uphold , since it can indicate to sceptical politicians and the public at large that universities are engaged in the visible activity which generates	performance	- indicators . In this climate ,  the academic in English and other subjects in the humanities ,  who is busy ,  who publishes a lot ,  who goes to conferences ,  cannot but be preferred to the quiet scholar ,  who keeps a low profile ,  even seems rather idle ,  but is taking his time over a major piece of scholarly writing that may involve many years '  work and which he does not intend to give to the world until he is ready .  Such people have in the past been left to go their own way without interference .	None
2905	performance	1	In this climate ,  the academic in English and other subjects in the humanities ,  who is busy ,  who publishes a lot ,  who goes to conferences ,  cannot but be preferred to the quiet scholar ,  who keeps a low profile ,  even seems rather idle ,  but is taking his time over a major piece of scholarly writing that may involve many years '  work and which he does not intend to give to the world until he is ready .  Such people have in the past been left to go their own way without interference .  Nowadays they may be esteemed by their peers who know something of their work , but this esteem has little currency value in the committee - rooms where	performance	is appraised . These academics may be respected ,  but they are also regarded as tiresome .  The culture of science looks for rapid and visible results ,  and it is this ,  despite occasional formal disavowals ,  that is setting the agenda .	None
2906	performance	1	Academics in English are loners reluctant to engage in team projects or pull together in research centres .  They can be irritatingly slow to publish ,  and it is often difficult to know how they spend their time .  On the brighter side , there are those younger and more active lecturers who do their duty and generate	performance	- indicators in the form of books and articles . It is true that in some cases these publications may be of extreme radical tendency ,  attacking the established  practices of academic English teaching ,  but that is no objection ,  since it is the fact of publication that counts ,  not its content .  The real problem is that the writers of such texts may make political difficulties within a department ,  or teach in ways difficult for students to understand .	None
2907	performance	1	The discussion may be restricted to impeccably intellectual topics ,  but the play of market forces is going on all the time just below the surface .  In one sense ,  everyone benefits from the buoyancy of academic book publishing .  The academic gets the publication record that leads to tenure or advancement , and his or her name becomes known in the profession ; the institution gains	performance	- indicators ; and the publisher keeps a full and interesting list . It is hard to speak against a situation that makes everyone happy ,  but one has to say it represents a form of intellectual inflation that is just as pernicious in its way as monetary inflation .  Far too many inferior or unnecessary academic books are published each year .	None
2908	performance	1	For Pound may have been wrong in selecting Fascist Italy as the modern society than came nearest to satisfying his Ruskinian demands ,  and yet right in thinking that societies should be judged according as they met ,  or failed to meet ,  that standard .  That he went grossly wrong in applying the standard does not mean that the standard as such was inapplicable .  However , most of us either no longer want to believe in the Ruskinian and Poundian relation between craftsmanlike	performance	and civic health , or else we tell ourselves ( perhaps with Pound 's fate before us as a cautionary tale ) that we can no longer afford to believe it . We are only just beginning to recognize that if we take this attitude ,  we are denying to arts and letters ,  and to the criticism of them ,  any bearing at all on public life  including ,  for instance ,  public education .  At any rate ,  though we would most of us like to maintain that Pound 's  Fascism is a quite distinct issue from Pound 's  poetry and his criticism ,  it is plain that we cannot do this .	None
2909	performance	2	This presumed death is the only unequivocal event in the whole work ,  however ,  and there are moments where its meditative air threatens to become bafflingly introspective .  Burrows seems to have lived with his material for so long that he has forgotten to throw out enough clues for the rest of us ,  and there are few hints as to why certain sequences are so important that they should be repeated over and over again But what constantly saves the piece from disappearing into itself is the obliquely moving nature of the central relationship and some patchy but startlingly lovely dance images .  The	performances	too are excellent , with all six dancers ( from the Royal ) sensitively adapting to the small scale of The Place ( no stagy projection or glazed expressions ) . Bristow and Trevitt never waver in the closeness of their mutual dialogue and move easily between forceful classical dynamics and quiet self - containment .  At 40 minutes this is an odd but oddly engrossing private journey .	None
2910	performance	2	OPERA NORTH 's  Tosca ,  first produced last year ,  is revived with a new conductor and two new principals ,  once again headed by the flame - haired Tosca of Mary Jane Johnson .  If its dramatic focus seems different ,  it is because Carlo Rizzi 's  tempi are rather faster than those adopted by Clive Timms ;  the action progresses less with inexorability than by abrupt shifts of mood .  Perhaps not every chord was quite in place , but this remains orchestrally an exciting	performance	; occasional poor balance between voice and stage emanates , I think , from the acoustic properties of the set . Johnson remains nearly ideal as the jealous ,  mercurial prima donna .  Her powerful and eloquent singing really does not need to be supplemented by low - register Sprechstimme ;  one can see the point ,  but Puccini is near enough to raw melodrama without such mannerism .	None
2911	performance	2	There was no sign of being unprepared in his typically confident singing ,  audible even at the end of Act One .  He already has a conception of Scarpia ,  a cunning brute who veers from calculated anger to cool appraisal of Tosca 's  bottom while her lover is being tortured .  One must hope that Maxwell will be well enough to assume the role next week , but meanwhile the company is to be congratulated on replacing him with so sterling a	performance	by this seasoned professional . Edmund Barham makes Cavaradossi almost as formidable ,  a convincing aristocrat ,  tender with Tosca ,  arrogant with Scarpia ,  and sung with true tone and great power .  Among minor roles I enjoyed Roger Bryson 's  fussy Sacristan ,  setting the scene of pious hypocrisy by lighting up during the Angelus .	None
2912	performance	3	At this level ,  eight games are too few to allow any margin for error  ( in world championship matches ,  they play 24 )  .  But with each loser taking home about 28,000 in prize money courtesy of Pilkington Glass ,  even the underdogs could afford to be a little more cheerful .  As if deliberately to disconcert the semi - finalists , the world champion , Garry Kasparov , has registered one of his most impressive	performances	. With one round still to play in the Interpolis tournament in Tilburg ,  Holland ,  he is already sure of first place .  Nine wins and four draws from thirteen games give him a score of 11 points ,  three points ahead of Viktor Korchnoi in second place .	None
2913	performance	4	The crowd had swollen to about 70 by now ,  standing in a respectful arc ,  as if the stage was protected by a sci - fi forcefield .  A couple of girls danced enthusiastically and several others tapped their feet .  A friend of the band weaved in and out of the crowd , recording their	performance	on a video camera . It was the only indication ,  apart from the price of the beer ,  that this was n't a decade ago. For the players ,  there was the prospect of returning to their day jobs with 50 in their pockets ,  for the landlord there was a healthy night 's  takings and for the crowd ,  even those who had stayed in the bar all evening ,  there was a nasty ringing in the ears the next morning .

2914	performance	5	Thermocouples at critical points in each fridge or other piece of equipment will show ,  through a computer print - out ,  how the temperature varies inside it .  Other items on test include the cold boxes in which vaccines are carried to villages ,  sterilisers for the syringes ,  stoves for the sterilisers and thermometers .  The outcome of the tests is to be a book of approved equipment , with details of	performance	, published by WHO and Unicef . An obvious snag is the power cuts which are common in third world countries .  The CRL tackled this problem a few years ago ,  developing ice - lined refrigerators :  tubes of water surrounding the fridge compartment freeze ;  if the power fails ,  the tubes keep the vaccines cool until all the ice has melted .	None
2915	performance	1	The Ferrari of Gerhard Berger finished second ,  26 seconds ahead of Alain Prost 's  McLaren .  Prost 's  result does little to further his cause in the championship if he has to drop his lower scores but Senna now knows that he must win the final two races in Japan and Australia .  Prost , meanwhile , can do no more and the pressure is now with his team - mate to repeat yesterday 's	performance	. While Senna 's  steady but swift progress made his 20th Grand Prix victory look easy ,  the reigning world champion says this race has been one of the toughest .  This is a very difficult circuit ,  Senna said .	None
2916	performance	1	The only consolation was a crowd at the Harvey Hadden Stadium of 2,581 ,  boosted by visiting fans .  In a bad - tempered match ,  Jason Ramshaw ,  the Halifax hooker ,  had his jaw broken ,  while his team - mate Richard Fairbank and Nottingham 's  Craig Whitehead were sent off .  Remarkably , Halifax 's	performance	meant that the First Division leaders Wigan , 66 - 0 winners in a 12 - try romp at Barrow , were not the day 's top scorers . Steve Clayton 's  eighth - minute dismissal for tripping hardly enhanced the home team 's  prospects .  Hull ended their four - game losing streak by beating Leeds 8 - 7 at The Boulevard .	None
2917	performance	4	Whitaker ,  the European champion ,  rides the same three horses as last year  Next Milton ,  Gammon and Hopscotch .  Milton 's  three 1988 victories included the winner - takes - all prize of 25,000 in the first running of the Next International Masters ,  which will be staged again on Friday evening .  This evening 's opening	performance	begins with the final of the first Olympic Star Spotters Championship , which aims to give riders of young horses the chance to test their potential stars . The idea has been warmly welcomed by David Broome ,  who has qualified Paul Schockemohle 's  seven - year - old Lotus for this evening 's  contest .  New Zealand 's  dual Olympic three - day event champion ,  Mark Todd ,  will also be in action on his latest Kiwi import ,  Double Take .	None
2918	performance	3	Digression won well enough ,  but the big minus factor against him is the fact that he is by the American stallion ,  Seattle Slew ,  whose progeny have tended not to train on over here .  Sheikh Mohammed 's  Bridal Toast ,  who finished powerfully to take second place could have more scope to progress as a Derby contender .  Fascinating though they are , thoughts of Classic confrontations to come were put on to the back - burner by another dazzling	performance	from Zilzal , who stamped himself as one of the outstanding milers of recent years with a thrashing of the French champion , Polish Precedent . Walter Swinburn finds it hard to believe Zilzal will ever be beaten and the son of Nureyev will attempt to extend his sequence to six out of six in next month 's  Breeders '  Cup Mile in Florida .  The good news is that he will not be rushed off to stud afterwards and will campaign for further honours next year when a move up to a mile and a quarter might be considered .	None
2919	performance	4	The main problem is the large ,  virtually all black cast  chorus ,  children and all .  Colour - blind casting would be as pointless as translating the libretto into Home Counties English .  So if , as seems likely , we have to wait a long time for a follow up to the triumphant Glyndebourne production , we should be all the more grateful for occasions like the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra 's concert	performance	( sponsored by English Estates ) . As it happens ,  the problems of an unstaged Porgy are hardly less acute  a cast of 24 soloists and a duration of three and a quarter hours are not easily managed in the concert hall .  Doubling up roles and cutting up to two fifths of the score may be practical necessities ,  but weaken the impact of the whole .	None
2920	performance	1	The Hundred Group recommends that nationalised industries should be allowed to borrow without Government guarantee and that the borrowings should be excluded from the PSBR .  Edward Weiss ,  chairman of the report 's  working party ,  said the recommendations were being put forward as an alternative to privatisation .  If the objective of privatisation is to improve management	performance	, it can be achieved in ways other than all - out privatisation , he said . The black and white approach used in this country ,  where a company is either wholly in the public sector or wholly in the private sector ,  is not mirrored on the Continent .  The fundamental problem with state - owned industries is that they are rationed of capital .	None
2921	performance	1	Mr Blum tried his supporters saying they had done better than predicted .  But it was a bad start for the CDU to the series of eight rounds of municipal or Land elections between now and the Bundestag elections .  It showed that despite the Chancellor 's unopposed re - election as chairman of his party and his tactical victory over leading rivals , voters are unimpressed with his	performance	and that of the CDU .

2922	performance	1	As a young doctor in Leiden he paid a seminal visit to the neuroanatomist WJH Nauta ,  at that time developing a revolutionary anatomical technique for investigating the nervous system by staining degenerating fibres cut off from their parent cell - bodies .  Kuypers was the first to use this technique in studies of the brain and over the next 10 years ,  now in the United States ,  he charted at a new level of detail the connections made by the cerebral cortex with nervous elements in the brain - stem and spinal cord that control movement in a number of higher mammals .  Kuypers then started a long series of collaborative studies in which injuries to some of these connections in the monkey 's brain were correlated with the defects they produced in	performance	of movements ; the poising of an arm , for instance , to carry out an operation with the fingers could be dissociated from the ability to use the fingers skilfully . These studies continued ,  with increasing sophistication ,  after his return to Europe in 1966 as Professor of Anatomy at the new Erasmus University in Rotterdam .  He showed that injury to connections within the cerebral cortex could cause the dissociation of hand movements guided by vision from those guided by touch .	None
2923	performance	1	But the Equal Pay and Opportunities Acts ,  introduced in Scotland in 1975 ,  changed all that .  Or were meant to .  Above the rank of inspector , promotion is a matter of	performance	and most tellingly , other senior ( male ) officers ' assessment . There were times ,  as Mhoira once wryly remarked ,  when she wished she could join the Masons or even use the gents '  lavatory .  Mhoira Robertson did take up golf ,  which became her favourite pastime ,  and eventually the promotions came ,  first as Director of studies and Chief Inspector at Tulliallan Police College and finally in 1987 as Superintendent within the Lothians and Borders force .

2925	performance	4	The organisers of a Dusseldorf trade show for manufacturers withdrew permission to film there after reading a scene in which German businessmen try to trick Wilcox .  In a previous BBC serial about the moral bankruptcy and satanic drabness of a fictional new town ,  the polite credits '  acknowledgment to the real modern conurbation which had admitted the cameras had an inadvertent satirical ring .  Accordingly , in the television Nice Work , Rummidge University is played by Birmingham University and fears that some may find the	performance	too convincing have prompted a closing caption , of conspicuously meticulous wording , thanking the real campus for its good - humoured co - operation . Rummidge is a fictional construct ,  explains Lodge .  The fact that it has some kind of playful relationship with Birmingham is something with which readers of my novels can easily cope .	None
2926	performance	2	It remains background music ,  and not just because ,  in Keith Turnbull 's  tidy production ,  the players are neatly packed away behind Gavin Semple 's  wonderful ,  octopoid hotel boiler .  Stylistically it asks few questions ,  becoming quickly locked into a limited area of harmonic discourse .  The show is redeemed by its	performance	. Fides Krucker and Chris Enns are superb as the two down - and - outs ,  using their voices with extreme cleverness to depict the alternate venality and heroic detachment of the trampish life .  Kevin Power has less luck with the gauchely conceived part of the boilerman .	None

2928	performance	2	The sentence is commuted to a life within prison walls when she volunteers to hang those due to swing beside her .  Lady Betty pursued a career of hanging and flogging well into the 19th century and Declan Donnellan 's  account of her life is told with a distressing mixture of savagery and sentiment ;  the hangwoman herself is portrayed by Sally Dexter with hateful harpiness relieved by startling moments of tenderness .  The play is enlivened by the vicious energy of the	performances	and by a variety of Irish music and dance which ranges from mournful ballads to the jolliest of jigs , transforming what could have been a dreary harangue into an invigorating ensemble work .

2929	performance	2	TODD ELDREDGE ,  the 18 - year - old former world junior champion ,  skated superbly to take the overall lead after the original programme at the Skate Electric UK International at Richmond Ice Rink last night .  The American ,  who had been lying second after the morning 's  compulsory figures ,  was placed first by all nine judges for both technical merit and presentation .  Eldredge 's	performance	took him past Grzegorz Filipowski . The Pole was first in the compulsory figures but could finish only third in the original programme ,  behind both Eldredge ,  and Vladimir Petrenko of the Soviet Union ,  in a nine - strong field .  Britain 's  two skaters ,  the Welsh - based Steven Cousins and John Martin ,  the Scottish champion from Ayr ,  were both outclassed .	None
2930	performance	1	We wanted revenge and I think we all felt the pressure because we wanted to win so badly ,  said Wood ,  who looked more like she was enjoying herself .  In contrast ,  at times Durie looked ready to scream ,  especially when the errors started creeping in during the second set of her 6 - 2 ,  7 - 6 win over the promising Yayuk Basuki .  Indeed , it was something of a typically topsy - turvy but none the less gritty	performance	from Durie , who missed a match point at 5 - 3 and then had to wait an hour to complete the encounter after rain fell at the end of the ninth game . She completed victory by taking the tiebreak 7 - 5 but not before she lost her serve to 5 - 5 and then saved a set point at 5 - 6 .  Such was the importance placed on the result by the players themselves that team manager Sue Mappin felt she was able to describe the win as a huge boost .	None
2931	performance	2	This ill - advised conceit casts a pall on the piece from the outset ,  and it does n't help that the skits  ( rewritten and reconstructed )  are crushingly unfunny .  But the trouble ,  you feel ,  lies with Belushi .  It may be that his gifts lay in the thrill and risk of live	performance	, losing their savour in aspic ; or , more likely , that his genius was always over - rated . Wired purports to be about America not just Belushi ,  but this is trite stuff about decadence in Tinseltown ;  what it has to say about the nation is nugatory ,  unless you count a depressing scene in which an audience collapses in laughter while the Voice of its Generation  ( as Bluto in Animal House )  stuffs a sandwich down his pants .  Belushi 's  a book ,  believes Woodward ,  but one is inclined to agree with the cop who pronounces him just another fat junkie who went belly - up.	None
2932	performance	2	Rather ,  the story acts as a framework for a series of ornamental tours de force .  The mime and dancing is throughout spectacular ,  a delight to the eye .  The	performance	of Durga Lal in the title role is a masterpiece of versatility and concentration : his delirium at the end of the first act is nothing short of hair - raising . To say that the recipe is naive would be to miss the point ,  but with the predominance of so much dance ,  drama is often lacking .  For instance ,  the death of Ghanashyam is ,  frankly ,  anticlimactic with most of the emphasis thrown onto the lovely succeeding threnodic dance .	None

But her chief work for music in Cumbria was as Secretary for 20 years of the Cumbria Rural Choirs .  Largely due to her courage and drive she enabled them to grow in stature so that the choirs were able to perform the major choral works drawing an audience of over 1,000 at a	performance	of the Dream of Gerontius and be broadcast with the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra on three occasions .

2934	performance	2	He had cut his teeth on Shakespeare with Ben Greet in 1931 and went on to enlarge his Shakespearian repertoire throughout the rest of his life .  I first saw him in a supporting role at the Croydon Rep in 1936 ,  where another young actor ,  seven years his junior ,  by the name of William Devlin ,  who dared to tackle King Lear at about the same time .  Dignam then enrolled in Michael McOwan 's company at the Westminster , appearing in Ibsen , Chekhov , O'Neill , Turgenev , Hamlet ( the Ghost and the First Player ) , skilfully differentiating his	performances	without ever falling into idle routine . For McOwan he played Justin O'Connell in Waste in 1937 ,  the same Granville - Barker play to which he returned 48 years later ,  as Russell Blackborough ,  with the Royal Shakespeare Company .  He was in the Lilian Baylis 1937 season at the Old Vic and returned to the Westminster for Pygmalion ,  Richard III ,  and more O'Neill ,  including a memorable portrayal of the old Ephraim Cabot in Desire Under The Elms in 1940 .

2938	performance	3	In the last minute ,  Bernie Gallacher ,  the Villa full - back ,  denied Wolves the chance of extra time when he headed Shane Westley 's  header from under the bar .  Wolves have now failed to progress beyond the second round since they won the then League Cup in 1980 .  If the result was not one for Graham Turner to celebrate on the third anniversary of his takeover at Wolves , the manner of their	performance	should certainly cheer him on his 42nd birthday today . It took Wolves 15 seconds to bring a Black Country barrage from the stands with their first ,  booming aerial pass for Bull to pursue ;  a further 30 seconds for Villa to concede a corner ;  and two minutes for Nigel Spink to be forced into a sprawling save by Mark Venus .  A pass from Venus sounds like the definitive long - ball game ,  and Villa 's  central defenders ,  Paul McGrath and Mountfield ,  did well to defend a series of attacks that came out of the night sky .	None
2939	performance	1	I had a second X - ray on my injury last week and it showed that the crack had healed .  I was surprised when the doctors said the injury had gone .  The England captain , who missed the World Cup match with Sweden in Stockholm last month because of bruised ribs , was happy with his	performance	against Portsmouth , saying : I was pleased to get through the 90 minutes . I was involved in some fairly strong tackling and did n't feel a thing .  Now I have another week to get my fitness up to the right level .	None
2940	performance	3	It is a real bonus after I fully expected him to be unavailable for the Poland match .  I 'm looking forward to the match and to seeing him training .  It really has been an amazing recovery and I understand he gave an outstanding	performance	in his comeback match . Bobby Robson received further encouragement when Stuart Pearce ,  the Nottingham Forest captain reported fit after taking part in the 3 - 3 Littlewoods draw at Huddersfield .  Forest prevailed after extra time on the away - goals rule.	None
2941	performance	2	Regular correspondence with the revered minimalist La Monte Young introduced him to the Dadaist movement Fluxus ,  but by the time he had won a Leonard Bernstein scholarship to the Berkshire School of Music in Massachusetts ,  I felt I 'd run my course as far as the avant - garde was concerned .  The dream ticket to America led to Lou Reed 's  primitive melodies and documentary realism ,  not John Cage .  Not that that prevented Cale from screaming at a potted plant sitting on his piano , or suddenly demolishing a table beside his stool with an axe in mid -	performance	. A lot of the things I did were done for shock value .  But when I joined the Velvet Underground ,  then it became a little bit more subliminal .	None
2942	performance	4	The Philharmonia carried it off well .  The frantic whirl of the outer sections framed a warm and full - blooded Andantino with some clear woodwind playing ,  while the well - handled lowering of dynamic in the final pages permitted an exhilarating ascent to Lyapunov 's  noisy ending .  Islamey was followed by a rather quirky	performance	of Beethoven 's Third Piano Concerto , in which the soloist was the 22 - year - old Olli Mustonen , a compatriot of the conductor . Comparisons are sometimes drawn between this work and Mozart 's  great K491 Concerto in the same key ,  which Beethoven is known to have played and admired .  The similarities ,  however ,  are mostly in matters of device  ( the piano arpeggios in the first movement Coda ,  for example ,  and the six - eight ending of the Rondo ,  tragic in Mozart ,  brilliant in Beethoven )  .	None
2943	performance	0	The story of its ill - fated Paris premiere in 1913 ,  which provoked fighting in the audience ,  is well known .  As it has become familiar over the years ,  the constant discord and the rhythmic complexities have ceased to shock .  Tuesday 's	performance	was outstanding , vivid and of surpassing clarity . The orchestra was in stunning form .  As for the conductor ,  Mr Salonen is making the going just now .	None
2944	performance	2	Over the years ,  Page has established himself as a medieval raconteur ,  delighting his audience with tales of ,  say ,  thirteenth - century Paris ;  but anecdotes aside ,  he has also been refining the presentation and programming so that ,  almost without realising it ,  his audiences learn a good deal about the often totally unfamiliar music being performed .  This concert ,  part of the Early Music Centre Festival ,  was one of the most overtly educative so far ,  with even ,  at one point ,  an illustrated guide to composing a motet in five easy stages .  Yet there is nothing condescendingly didactic in Page 's manner , nor anything textbookish about Gothic Voices '	performance	. Beyond this ,  what might appear just to be a way of illustrating how motets were put together  singing the two or three different ,  often highly contrasted melodies individually before putting them together as a polyphonic ,  multi - texted whole  may equally well represent a valid reflection of the manner in which they were originally performed .  More often than not ,  each melodic line stands perfectly well by itself ,  and hearing it thus at least lends something of the sense of familiarity and recognition that the thirteenth - century literati might have enjoyed if they attempted to disentangle aurally the separate strands of the motet .	None
2945	performance	3	By TERENCE WILKINSON ,  Assistant City Editor ETAM ,  the fashion retailer ,  saw its profits before property income rise by 10.3 per cent to 6.3m in the six months to 12 August .  But , despite this resilient	performance	, its share price dropped 14p to 192p on fears of a renewed slump in high street spending . Etam sales ,  up 32 per cent to 84.3m on an increase in trading space of 29 per cent ,  appeared to benefit from the hot summer weather and its low - priced fashion for younger women seemed not to suffer greatly from the effects of higher mortgages .  Pre - tax profits showed a more modest 2.5 per cent increase to 6.3m in the absence of last time 's  409,000 of property profits ,  and after a slightly higher tax charge earnings per share were almost unchanged at 6.22p .	None
2946	performance	1	The outer group includes the heads of programming departments .  Mr Dunn ,  who is currently devising an incentive plan for Thames Television ,  said he believed ITV had to motivate and retain the services of all its staff ,  but that schemes should be devised to spread profit sharing and share ownership company wide .  He added that special incentives should perhaps apply to the top 10 managers , whose	performances	will be crucial in retaining the franchise . Mr Bland said last night :  Our scheme is designed to ensure that LWT is in a position to make and broadcast programmes at the weekend from 1993 onwards .  Barry Cox ,  LWT communications director ,  said that the company was unable to comment or discuss the scheme before publication .	None
2947	performance	2	This ill - advised conceit casts a pall on the piece from the outset ,  and it does n't help that the skits  ( rewritten and reconstructed for copyright reasons )  are crushingly unfunny .  But the trouble ,  you feel ,  lies with Belushi .  It may be that his gifts lay in the thrill and risk of live	performance	, losing their savour in aspic ; or , more likely , that his genius was always overrated .

2948	performance	3	Strikers in the Staffordshire Senior League are currently facing a weighty problem of similar proportions .  Sid Kelly ,  who minds the net for table - topping Eccleshall ,  is believed to tip the scales at around 20 stones .  The roly - poly goalie makes heads turn on away grounds when he runs out , and some of his diving stops have been measured on the Richter Scale , but his	performances	invariably win respect from opponents and spectators . Eccleshall ,  from a scenic village north - west of the county town ,  are more accustomed to propping up the league than heading it .  Last Saturday ,  however ,  with Sid on - song between the sticks ,  they held Stafford Rangers '  second string to a 0 - 0 draw and have yet to lose .	None
2949	performance	4	His Equity - required understudy received 800 per  without having to learn a line .  The producer sent him the script ,  in case he was curious ,  but assured him there was no question of him appearing on stage in the role .  Had Kingsley been ill , the	performance	would have been cancelled . The play 's  the thing ,  but ,  in a one - man show ,  the actor is the play :  not Ben Kingsley in Edmund Kean ,  but Ben Kingsley as Edmund Kean or even ,  as those ultra - butch radio commercials put it ,  Ben Kingsley IS Edmund Kean .  We are there to attend not a play but a performance .	None
2950	performance	4	Had Kingsley been ill ,  the performance would have been cancelled .  The play 's  the thing ,  but ,  in a one - man show ,  the actor is the play :  not Ben Kingsley in Edmund Kean ,  but Ben Kingsley as Edmund Kean or even ,  as those ultra - butch radio commercials put it ,  Ben Kingsley IS Edmund Kean .  We are there to attend not a play but a	performance	. You can see why this appeals to actors .  Of the greatest player of her day ,  Jane Austen wrote only that We were quite satisfied with Mr. Kean ,   which may not look so good splashed across the marquee but which is all many of the experts demand :  as far as Miss Austen is concerned ,  he did n't get in the way of the drama .	None
2951	performance	2	Of the greatest player of her day ,  Jane Austen wrote only that We were quite satisfied with Mr. Kean ,   which may not look so good splashed across the marquee but which is all many of the experts demand :  as far as Miss Austen is concerned ,  he did n't get in the way of the drama .  If we 're honest ,  most of us reviewers prefer to engage in a dialogue with the author and director ,  addressing concepts of political theatre rather than the actor 's  little trick of twitching his left ear .  So , we bang on about the play and the staging and the big themes , and , if there 's any space left , then , as the chairman of Critics ' Forum wearily intones , I suppose we ought to say something about the	performances	. In his own solo ,  Edward Petherbridge quotes James Agate 's  comparison of actors with puppets :  Punch and Judy have no understanding of their show .  What better way for the hired hand to disprove the notion than to dispense with writers and stagers entirely 	None
2952	performance	2	So ,  the star compiles and writes the evening ,  and calls in a fellow thesp to direct :  Petherbridge 's  The Eight O'Clock Muse is staged by Peter Barkworth ,  John Sessions 's  Napoleon  The American Story by Kenneth Branagh  ( a promising young actor ,  in case you had n't heard )  .  In both these shows ,  there 's  an odd sense of being in some sort of parallel universe :  it all looks the same ,  but the power structure has been weirdly distorted .  Petherbridge mentions Chekhov and Shakespeare , but , for him , theatre is something made by	performance	not writing . That 's  character ,  he says ,  after doing a few undulations .  Truly it is .	None
2953	performance	4	Fourteen percussionists here had a stage of their own ,  stretching around half of the choir seats ,  and the average decibel count from the brass was well up in proportion .  The concern ,  though ,  was always with where the music was going and which of its layers were propelling it ,  so that the occasional sudden stillnesses became a real opening - up of another dimension in the music 's  workings and vision ,  not just a refuelling stop for the orchestra .  Thrills with thought : this astonishing piece is necessarily a rare event , and it would be a shame if so astute a	performance	went unrevived . Ives 's  Three Places in New England also had a philosophical ,  meditative character ,  rather than a passionate or temperamental one .  The march tunes heaped up with proper brashness and a wild final acceleration ,  but the collage until then kept a rare sense of harmonic direction .	None
2954	performance	4	Turnage has produced a work which is attractive ,  disturbing and memorable :  an impressive curtain - raiser to a three - year association with the CBSO from which more works are destined to flow .  The decision to interpose Stravinsky 's  Suite No 1 for Small Orchestra as a kind of buffer zone between Beethoven 's  Leonora No 3 and the Turnage was little short of inspired .  The Stravinsky was a welcome up - beat to the new work and it drew a veil over a	performance	of the overture which apart from a cracking final Presto was emminently forgettable . Brahms '  Fourth Symphony ,  now something of a hardy annual with Rattle and the CBSO ,  provided the conclusion .  Scrutinising this familiar object revealed some untidy details in the first movement :  the performers have not quite solved the problem of what must be one of the cruellest openings for an orchestra ever devised .	None
2955	performance	3	Ferranti ,  helped by option influences ,  rose 1.5p to 59p .  ADT ,  benefiting from a US investment road show ,  gained 6p to 206p .  Guinness , reflecting its strong profits	performance	, jumped 25p to 597p . But cider maker HP Bulmer ,  perceived as an interest rate casualty ,  fell 10p to 172p .  BAT Industries improved 17.5p to 850.5p on Hoylake 's  expression of continuing interest .	None
2956	performance	1	A league table published by Charterhouse ,  the merchant bank ,  showed Lord Hanson was Britain 's  highest - paid director of a public company ,  earning 1.239m last year .  Sir Ralph Halpern of Burton Group and John Gunn of British and Commonwealth were not so fortunate .  They suffered 25 per cent	performance	- related pay cuts , dropping to 996,000 and 740,700 respectively . Also suffering was Sir Derek Alun - Jones ,  chairman of Ferranti International Signal ,  the troubled electronics company .  Trustees representing substantial Ferranti family interests wrote to Sir Derek asking for the board to be replaced or supplemented by new directors .	None
2957	performance	5	Prestige comes in the shape of a Mercedes with the 240D or Stuttgart Taxi ,  commanding 7,000 but returning unfailing reliability .  Even if lead levels in the atmosphere do not bother you ,  I am sure you will find the fact that unleaded petrol is 15p cheaper ,  and that diesel fuel boosts mpg by at least a third ,  most interesting .  Motoring : Miles of smiles as the diesel comes of age : Brett Fraser on the Citroen AX , which offers fuel economy without much sacrifice in	performance	to drivers willing to turn away from the petrol engine By BRETT FRASER BACK IN the bad old days ,  drivers of diesel cars were the social outcasts of the motoring world .	None
2958	performance	5	The AX is the smallest of the Citroen range and is available in three - and five - door versions .  Computers were used extensively during the car 's  development ,  in a successful attempt to make the AX 220lb lighter than the class average .  The significance is the boost it gives to the AX 's	performance	, particularly in the context of the diesel . Here is a diesel - engine car which will out - gun many of its petrol - engine rivals .  It comes close to shaming some of its own stable - mates ,  too ,  and they are among the swiftest in their class .	None
2959	performance	5	Overheating and loose valvegear chains ,  both of which can abruptly extinguish all mechanical life ,  are its  ( avoidable )  weaknesses .  With the wisdom of hindsight ,  it is easy to see now that the Stag 's  troublesome V8 ,  designed and inadequately developed in - house by Triumph before it merged with Leyland ,  should have been ditched and replaced by Rover 's  proven ex - Buick 3.5 - litre V8  ( still used by Land - Rover ,  Morgan ,  TVR and others )  that was already on the shelf .  In the interests of dependability , many Stags have subsequently been converted to Rover V8 power , gaining in reliability ( and quite possibly in	performance	) what they lose in originality and nose heaviness . A Rover - engine Stag may well be a better car than one with Triumph power ,  but as a hybrid it will never be so valuable .  Ford V6 conversions are intrinsically even less desirable  though worth considering as a cheap and reliable engine .	None
2960	performance	5	Far from it .  The engine 's  lovely ,  lugging delivery  ( it is not all bad ,  you see )  serves as an antidote to frenetic driving .  Whereas most modern	performance	cars encourage aggression through their virulence , the Stag suppresses it while getting there just as quickly . Anyone who is not relaxed and glowing with a sense of well - being at the wheel of a good Stag should keep their money in the building society .  Age and mileage have little to do with values any more .	None
2961	performance	2	All these schemings take a lot of energy ,  and Mr Pozsgay has plenty .  He darts around the country in the same blue pin - stripe suit ,  delivering variations of the same speech .  He frequently gives interviews , and has got television	performances	down to a fine art . His boyish smile and double chin are now instantly recognised by Hungarian and  increasingly  by foreign viewers .  In his spare time he reads social science journals and contemporary Hungarian literature ,  or cooks for his family or friends .	None
2962	performance	1	Despite official denials ,  it appears the US did agree to play a limited ,  and deniable ,  role in the rebellion .  US officials place most of the blame for the debacle on half - cock rebel tactics ,  and a lack of adequate advance consultation with Washington .  But the White House Chief of Staff , John Sununu , has started an inquiry into the administration 's	performance	in one of its first efforts in foreign policy crisis management . The administration 's  enemies ,  both on the Democratic left and the Republican right ,  were still circling yesterday hoping to draw political blood .  In a speech to the Senate on Thursday night ,  Senator Jesse Helms compared the US performance to that of the keystone cops .	None

2964	performance	4	With the exception of three years in the mid - Fifties ,  Rowicki continued as its artistic director and principal conductor until 1977 .  For a short period from 1952 to 1954 he was Professor of Conducting at the Warsaw Conservatoire .  From 1965 to 1970 Rowiecki also served as musical director of the Theatr Wielki , Warsaw 's huge opera and ballet theatre , and presided over the opening	performance	of the reconstructed building in 1965 , conducting Moniuszko 's Straszny Dwor ( ' The Haunted House ' a characteristically Polish mix of folklore and Bellinian melody ) . But the exigencies of operatic life did not really appeal to one of his perfectionist standards .  He preferred touring with his orchestra and ,  increasingly ,  guest conducting abroad .	None
2965	performance	2	Nigel Andrews ,  Financial Times .  In terms of performance the film is praiseworthy ,  with a consistent ,  naturalistic ,  undeclamatory style that still respects the poetry Kenneth Branagh 's own	performance	correct , passionless , all intelligence - will be entirely a matter of taste . David Robinson ,  The Times .  This Henry V is an achievement of some character and resource ,  warts and all .	None
2966	performance	2	It is fair to say that the real chemistry is not between actor and part ,  but between the idea of the star as entrepreneur and the idea of the king as a self - made man. Adam Mars - Jones ,  The Independent .  The best thing about Wired was Michael Chiklis 's touching and convincing	performance	in the central role of John Belushi . Otherwise ,  there seemed little to commend it .  The filmic device of a discarnate Belushi reviewing his life allows the dead performer  ( and Hollywood collectively )  a right of reply ;  unfortunately it also makes the film ludicrous .	None
2967	performance	2	Toshack has wasted no time in putting his stamp on the side ,  moving the West German midfielder Bernd Schuster to libero ,  Michel from the right flank to central midfield ,  and giving the striker Emilio Butragueno a slightly withdrawn role .  And those with their ears to the dressing - room wall have yet to report rumbles .  Toshack has taken pains to play down the hard - man image he brought from San Sebastian , swearing that the extra training ordered after the poor	performance	at Castellon was not a punishment . While Real are unbeaten ,  the relative honeymoon will continue for a man whom the late Bill Shankly ,  with characteristic caution ,  once said was destined to become the top manager in the game .  Toshack 's  admiration for Shankly ,  who signed him for Liverpool from Cardiff in 1970 ,  is unquestionably deep :  still the overwhelming influence on his career .	None
2968	performance	5	In water ,  it splits like a spider 's  web into gossamer strands while retaining its basic strength .  Many anglers are hailing it as the most significant advance in fishing tackle during the past 20 years and Dave Chilton ,  the man who has popularised its use ,  believes that the line ,  made from the world 's  strongest man - made fibre  ( Lancia uses it to strengthen the internal bodywork of its cars )  ,  may revolutionise all branches of the sport .  In many parts of the world , fish are still being caught by bow and arrow and it was a bowstring which first put Chilton , a Bolton lorry driver , on to the potential of the high -	performance	polyethylene fibres . He had been experimenting with dental floss ,  which was multi - stranded but then broke when rubbed against rocks or weeds .  I was delivering to industry and kept a constant look - out for a suitable material .	None
2969	performance	3	The All Whites ,  incidentally ,  have their own All Black date in a fortnight .  Quins need Paul Ackford fit to face Bedford far more than they do today .  He picked up a groin injury during his heroic	performance	in Lions colours in France and , with exhaustion probably exacerbating his condition , he makes way for David Thresher in the second row . The prop Andy Mullins ,  like Ackford and Thresher an England squad member ,  is another absentee ,  with a twisted ankle .  Brian Moore ,  the Lions hooker ,  makes his first appearance of the season  -  having rested since the tour of Australia  for Nottingham at Northampton .	None
2970	performance	2	TELEVISION / Certified excellence :  Mark Lawson on Ashcroft 's  second childhood By MARK LAWSON HEAVY with prizes from Venice , She 's Been Away ( BBC1 ) was , superficially , one of those pieces in which a major star offers what might be called a Complex Simpleton	performance	. Reigning in their verbal and facial expressiveness to play a character so damaged that a big speech is possible  ( if at all )  only at the end ,  they subsequently receive an award from a jury awed that they were clever enough to play so dumb .  Peggy Ashcroft duly got her gong for playing Lilian ,  50 years in the bin ,  but She 's  Been Away was considerably more than a kind of Rain Woman ;  a vehicle for acting technique .	None
2971	performance	1	It is relatively easy to operate such a system where trading is involved and many are in specialist grades as in Her Majesty 's  Stationery Office ,  the up - and - running agency with the most sophisticated pay arrangements so far .  Offering it to armies of administrative assistants doing non - commercial jobs in the great clerical factories underpinning the benefits system and in a nation - wide network of local offices ,  is another matter .  They are looking at job - weighting , concepts of stewardship and	performance	measurement in the knowledge that greater flexibility in pay ( and recruitment ) will be crucial factors in escaping from what Mr Montagu calls the rigidities that have bedevilled us in the past . The feasibility study prepared by Stephen Hickey ,  an assistant secretary ,  which provided the agency blueprint for the DSS ,  was unequivocal about the key asset in the operation  people will represent the prime resource of any social security agency  and blunt in saying morale in some areas is low virtually no local office staff were happy to admit working for social security .  Mr Montagu and Mr Brown believe getting staff not to fear the agency process as a bringer of cuts or worse conditions ,  but as a way of improving both and service to the customer ,  is the crucial task facing ministers and senior officials between now and spring 1991 .	None
2972	performance	5	At a seminar hosted by the Edinburgh Concurrent Supercomputer Project last month ,  researchers and vendors could finally say with confidence that supercomputing in the 1990s and beyond will be done by parallel computers .  There are fundamental limits to how fast a conventional computer can go .  Data cannot be moved from the processor to the memory and back faster than a certain speed , which limits the	performance	of the computer as a whole . Another limitation is the extent to which components can be shrunk before quantum effects decrease their reliability .  Faced with these problems ,  computer scientists began in the mid 1970s to experiment with using many processors in a single machine to work in parallel on a single problem .	None
2973	performance	5	Still owned by its employees ,  Meiko has broken into the American and Japanese supercomputer markets ,  and now has offices across the US and in Europe .  The largest of its Computing Surface machines is at the University of Edinburgh .  Faced with the loss of their previous high -	performance	computer in 1987 , the university got backing from the Science and Engineering Research Council and the Department of Trade and Industry to purchase a large Computing Surface to serve both as a research vehicle and a flagship site for Meiko . The Edinburgh Concurrent Supercomputer Project  ( ECSP )  ,  under Professor David Wallace ,  now has the largest parallel computer in Europe ,  with 400 processors which can perform 400 million arithmetical calculations a second .  The example of the installation at Edinburgh has led to several million dollars '  worth of business which ,  according to Meiko ,  would have been much harder to obtain without a such a proof of cost - effectiveness .

2974	performance	1	The winner may now become Glover 's  first runner in a Group race .  His mission had been planned two years ago when he worked well with stablemate Balthus ,  the 1987 Cambridgeshire winner ,  and Glover promises he has something else in the yard to continue the trend in two years .  For the successful jockey , Dean McKeown , it was some compensation for the dismal	performance	of 2,000 Guineas hope Message Pad on Friday . McKeown has not given up on the north 's  hope for next year 's  Classic ,  who was found to have a temperature after finishing last in the Somerville Tattersall Stakes .  He 's  got a real motor ,  but that day the engine fell out ,  said the jockey .	None
2975	performance	1	When you are always trying to make your best shots you sometimes miss .  In a long match like this it is really difficult to play your best for three and a half hours .  Lendl 's concern that Mecir 's shrewder shots would pass him in mid - court made for a characteristic back - court	performance	and a 6 - 4 , 4 - 6 , 4 - 6 , 6 - 1 , 6 - 4 victory for a 100,000 ( 62,500 ) prize . While it would be a mistake to regard such matches too seriously when they lack the edge of grand prix conditions ,  Lendl 's  tactical reticence was interesting .  Mecir could not envisage his fellow Czechoslovak changing a successful routine .	None
2976	performance	1	England 0 Australia .  .  0 STEVE TAYLOR probably established himself as the rightful successor to his more famous namesake ,  Ian ,  when he gave an outstanding performance of goalkeeping in England 's  final game in the Lada Classic at Luton yesterday  -  a goalless draw with the world champions .  The result was enough ,  however ,  to give Australia the trophy .  Following their disappointing	performance	against the Dutch on Saturday when they lost 5 - 1 , England made a number of changes , including dropping captain Richard Leman and introducing a young right - wing triangle of Chris Mayer , Russell Garcia and Rob Hill . It was Mayer who gave the experienced Michael York a torrid afternoon and created a string of opportunities with penetrating crosses .

2977	performance	3	It was the champions '  first defeat since losing to Hull in the First Division at the start of April  a run of 13 successive victories .  Jeff Hardy led the Sheffield spree with two tries ;  the others came from Bruce McGuire ,  Warren Smiles and Sonny Nickle ,  with Mark Aston kicking five goals .  The Eagles ' manager , Gary Hetherington , said afterwards : It was a tremendous	performance	and a great day for us . What made it more significant was that over 7,000 Sheffield fans were following us .  A year ago ,  the Eagles were drawing three - figure crowds to Owlerton greyhound stadium .	None

2979	plan	2	It was no particular shock when I found out ;  I had expected the test to be positive .  I was a very happy gay man. There was clearly a need to adapt my lifestyle , but playing the role of victim was never among my	plans	. You can be perfectly well with HIV and at other times chronic debility makes it hard to do even the basic things .  In the early days the stigma of being HIV positive had driven away about 60 of my circle of friends .	None
2980	plan	3	Santiago ,  Chile :  On a warm autumn evening in 1990 international rock star Sting dances on stage with a group of Chilean mothers and grandmothers of the disappeared .  The event ,  organized by the Chilean Section of Amnesty International ,  is entitled An Embrace of Hope .  Moscow , USSR : At the same time , 12,000 miles away , a delegation from Amnesty 's International Secretariat is making	plans	for a fledgling Moscow Group to participate in the Women in the Front Line campaign . To outsiders ,  the two events may seem little more than an international organization at work ,  but for Amnesty members these events are charged with significance .  The Cold War was at its height when Peter Benenson ,  the British lawyer ,  founded Amnesty ,  and three decades later it is hard to believe that the Moscow AI Group finally has permission to become part of Soviet life .	None
2981	plan	3	Interpretation is the heading which is the most wide - ranging of the three elements ,  including questions of  form or style ,  but perhaps additionally considering the work 's  historical background ,  and technical ,  thematic or other questions ,  including the artist 's  biography .  The evaluation is a summing up which places the work in the experience of the critic ,  and helps the reader to form a judgement .  The	plan	of the book , then , is simple . After the first two chapters ,  it discusses where and how to read art criticism .  While this first chapter has outlined what that criticism is ,  the next gives sketches of half a dozen critical types .	None
2982	plan	2	The White Rabbit had put on his spectacles ,  but he did not know where to start .  Begin at the beginning ,  the King said gravely ,  and go on till you come to the end :  then stop .    Many art books follow this	plan	, especially those aiming to take in a national culture or a whole civilisation . Art histories often make an attempt to keep to chronology ,  although the difficulties include the crucial fact that in art there is no clear sequence of events .  Unlike old - fashioned narrative history ,  art has no decisive battles ,  no international treaties ,  and no changes of government .	None
2983	plan	2	Sculptures in cities are a part of cultural history ,  and can be the symbols by which the cities are known or remembered .  Rome is distinguished by the statue on the Capitoline Hill of Marcus Aurelius ;  New York ,  even the United States ,  is symbolised by the Statue of Liberty ;  Copenhagen is remembered for its mermaid .  Also , the history of sculpture includes some account of the abortive	plans	for sculpture , just as the history of architecture is incomplete as a history of ideas without a knowledge of rejected proposals . Even though the same might be argued for painting ,  the technical obstacles to be overcome for painting are very much less than for sculpture .  Again ,  this is where sculpture is closely aligned to social and political history .	None
2984	plan	2	In The Periodic Table  he mentions a woman dear to my heart who was murdered at Auschwitz :  but the book on Auschwitz does not discuss his relationship with her .  In The Wrench  he creates the rigger Faussone ,  the practical man whose cranes girdle the world and who keeps returning ,  a little heavy - footed ,  to the house in Turin where two old aunts fuss over his welfare :  Faussone was spoken of as my alter ego ,  and the book has to struggle to accommodate him as a second person ,  available for interview by Levi .  These omissions and transpositions indicate that Levi could well have kept to himself any	plan	he may have formed to end his life . During the meeting with him a few months before his death which was recorded in an article published in the London Review  ,  Philip Roth found him as keen as mustard :  here was someone who listened ,  with the intent stillness of a chipmunk .  Levi had a high opinion of the grain of mustard ,  and of salt .	None
2985	plan	2	It was basically envisaged to be of national proportions as well as non - denominational ,  with religious instruction given in separate classes .  There was ,  however ,  controversy from the start .  The Church of Ireland withdrew its schools from the	plan	which threatened that church 's dominance over the primary sector . The presbyterians also had misgivings ,  and only came back into the system in 1838 when they were practically guaranteed control of their own schools within it .  The Church of Ireland rejoined in 1860 ,  because it lacked funds to continue its own system .	None
2986	plan	2	So ,  wrote Harsnet ,  there is continuity as well as discontinuity ,  but that does not mean ,  he wrote ,  that there exists what is called character ,  personality ,  character  ,  Goldberg wrote in the margin ,  personality  ,  as they seem to think ,  wrote Harsnet  ( and Goldberg went on typing )  ,  when they say you have such a generous character if you would only recognize it ,  or you have so much to offer ,  or it is not for myself I speak but for you ,  not for myself I mourn but for the waste of all that generosity ,  when they pour those words over you ,  character ,  generosity ,  warmth ,  looking sad ,  shedding tears ,  putting on a brave face ,  saying do n't pay any attention to me ,  or ,  it 's  nothing ,  forget it ,  I 'm crying for the waste ,  meaning waste if it 's  not directed towards them ,  but you have only to see what happens when one lets oneself be persuaded by that sort of thing ,  wrote Harsnet ,  you have only to see what happened to Hutchinson ,  MacMahon ,  Rollins and Goldberg .  Taken in by the image of yourself they present you with ,  wrote Harsnet ,  instead of waiting in patience for the beginning ,  instead of waiting and then beginning ,  though beginning ,  having begun ,  he wrote ,  is not everything ,  is far from everything .  It is quite possible , he wrote , that it will lead nowhere , even when one has begun at the right time in the right spirit , or at least not at the wrong time , in the wrong spirit , with the wrong	plans	and having made the wrong preparations , with the wrong tools and the wrong principles , on the wrong surface and with the wrong conception . Though it may well be ,  he wrote ,  that one actually achieves  more working with the wrong plans and in the wrong spirit ,  with the wrong tools and the wrong principles ,  on the wrong surface and with the wrong conception ,  it may well be ,  he wrote  ( and Goldberg typed )  ,  that one achieves more than working with the right plans and in the right spirit ,  with the right tools and the right principles ,  on the right surface and with the right conception ,  though right and wrong and more and less are relative concepts and what seems right at one moment to one person may seem wrong at the same moment to another Person or at another moment to the same person ,  and what seems more to one person at one moment may seem less to another person at the same moment or at another moment to the same person ,  right ,  wrong ,  more ,  less ,  relative concepts  ,  scribbled Goldberg ,  in the margin ,  panting slightly as he bent over his old Olivetti Portable ,  there is only the beginning ,  wrote Harsnet ,  or rather ,  there is only having begun ,  beginning  ,  scribbled Goldberg ,  aware now of the black stains on his hands left by the felt - tip pen ,  having begun  ,  there is only the feeling in the pit of the stomach or the feeling in the chest ,  wrote Harsnet ,  the feeling of sickness or the feeling of elation ,  those are not relative ,  he wrote ,  those are absolute .  Yet is it possible to assert ,  he wrote ,  that work done with a lifting of the heart is better  than work done with a contracting of the stomach 	None
2987	plan	2	Though it has to be said ,  he wrote ,  and Goldberg ,  his eye racing down the page covered in his friend 's  tiny handwriting ,  paused to sip from the glass of fresh orange - juice at his side ,  wiped his forehead and went on typing ,  it has to be said that I have occasionally had the illusion  that I knew what step to take first and even ,  occasionally ,  what step to take second ,  I will not talk about a third .  There is of course no logical reason why things should be different this time ,  wrote Harsnet ,  why this too should not be an illusion ,  the illusion of imagining that I know not only what step to take first but also what step to take second and even what step to take third .  No logical reason , he wrote , but that will not make me change my	plans	once I have begun . Night ,  he wrote ,  work on the big glass and on the notes for the big glass ,  day ,  sleep and write this freewheeling commentary on the entire project ,  viz. on the big glass and on the notes for the big glass .

2988	plan	2	I need to move slowly across from the left and see where things start to go wrong ,  he wrote .  Except that I cannot work like that .  I have made my	plans	and I must stick to them . Even in the plan ,  though ,  I now realize ,  he wrote ,  there was a certain vagueness about the right hand side of both panels .  Perhaps because in painting as in writing we start from top left hand side ,  so that the right is always  less clear .	None
2989	plan	1	Except that I cannot work like that .  I have made my plans and I must stick to them .  Even in the	plan	, though , I now realize , he wrote , there was a certain vagueness about the right hand side of both panels . Perhaps because in painting as in writing we start from top left hand side ,  so that the right is always  less clear .  Interesting to examine the old masters from that point of view ,  he wrote .	None
2990	plan	0	However ,  he wrote ,  for that very reason ,  the right hand side should have been even more  solid ,  even more  thought through than the left .  But there it is ,  he wrote .  The	plans	are made , work has begun , there is no going back . Work as the fancy takes me ,  he wrote .  A little bit here ,  a little bit there .	None
2991	plan	2	In other words ,  he wrote ,  am I right or wrong to see this as decisive    Is that an insight into how things really are ,  or only one more passing thought    My	plans	have been well laid , he wrote . The project is well under way .   There is no reason to fail .	None
2992	plan	1	But in the end very disappointing .  As is often the case ,  some last - minute idea blossoms while what had seemed a brilliant solution and been pondered for ages falls quite flat .  That is why there has to be the big glass and the notes in the box , not the glass alone or the notes alone , but the box , with all my preliminary notes and measurements , all my	plans	and blueprints , and then the glass , with the end product of all those notes visible on its surface . Consider ,  he wrote .  Where is the image 	None
2993	plan	3	Not to be sidetracked for any reason whatsoever  .  Not to give in to temptation ,  no matter what form it takes  .  But difficult at times to remember why I ever made such a	plan	, he wrote . Or even if there was any plan at all .  Or any glass at all .	None
2994	plan	2	Then :  Can I see it   I took him in and watched as he studied it .  You have n't taken up any of those	plans	about the boxing - match , he said . Or the waterfall .  I stood at the window and looked down into the street .	None

None
2996	plan	3	There appears to be no creative public vision which will help the survival of the pub or help ensure a healthy and varied pub stock .  History ,  indeed ,  tends to show that public intervention can have the effect of reinforcing rather than curbing market excesses .  It was the licensing system and licensing controls , after all , which helped to foster Britain 's peculiar brewery tie and concentrate pub ownership in the hands of the brewers in the first place ; and it was the same system which connived at and partly encouraged the modern contagion of open -	plan	pub designs . In addition ,  the 1989 MMC Report ,  conceived as an attack in the public interest on the monopoly power of the major brewers and requiring the untying of large chunks of their tied estates ,  may have devastating consequences for traditional pubs .  For despite their other shortcomings ,  most of the major brewers have been able and willing to cross - subsidise many less profitable houses .	None
2997	plan	3	At the Saracen 's  Head at Towcester ,  for example ,  a recent proposal to historicise the pub involved extensive destruction of genuine historic fabric and the introduction of the worst cliches of traditional pub detail ,  such as bulls - eye glass and copper lanterns .  In recent years serious damage to the historic interiors of pubs has resulted from the creation of the open - plan which now seem to be pubs '  standard internal layout .  Often the creation of the open	plan	interior requires the removal of walls , chimney breasts , stairs and other internal features of interest , which is highly destructive of the building 's historic character . The owner of The Hollybush at Elstree proposed to infill an original coach arch in the pub 's  facade and to demolish the timber framed side walls of the passageway behind in order to form a larger and open interior ,  even though it was this feature that distinguished the building as an historic inn .  In the most extreme cases the existing building is so different from the historic pub concept that a virtual rebuild is proposed .	None
2998	plan	3	A good example of this can be found in the sleep village of Buckland in Oxfordshire !  The Lamb ,  a picturesque village pub closed some years ago by Allied ,  was reopened in 1989 as a free house after an extensive remodelling  which involved the complete gutting of the original unexceptional but characterful ,  partitioned interior .  Now nothing remains whatsoever of the old fittings , features or proportions ; in their place is a vast , open -	plan	space with bright white walls , bistro furniture and cheery chintz . A similar treatment was recently meted out by Allied 's  Tetley Walker subsidiary to what remains a fundamentally Georgian pub in an urban setting near Manchester  the Church Inn at Lowton .  Having applied cement render over the external brickwork ,  attached a hideous modern porch and added an extension in jarring and inappropriate modern materials ,  the brewery designers have gutted the interior .	None
2999	plan	3	One such example is the Grade II Pen and Parchment on Bridgefoot in Stratford - upon - Avon ,  where the barn at the back of the pub was used as a theatre throughout the 18th century .  Such appropriately Stratfordian associations have ,  however ,  been totally disregarded by Whitbread in their recent cavalier remodelling of the complex .  Not only are the pub interiors themselves of the nondescript , open -	plan	kind , but the barn to the rear has been wholly mutilated . Fortunately ,  not all recent pub refurbishments have been in this vein .  A number of the big breweries have recently made encouraging moves towards a more sympathetic attitude to their historic pubs .	None

3001	plan	0	The rich variety of pub types created during the 19th century has subsequently been largely lost by redevelopment and remodelling .  This not only makes an understanding of the nature of Victorian pubs difficult ,  but also means that those which do survive merit special care and attention .  One of the most important changes in pub design during this period was in the	plan	. Pre - Victorian pubs were largely run on the basis of waiter - service ,  following from the original concept that the pub was a house open to the public for refreshment  hence the term public house .  Thus the introduction of bar service was a revolution .	None
3002	plan	3	Thus the introduction of bar service was a revolution .  Bar service enabled various different rooms ,  or cabins within rooms ,  to be served from a central point ;  many late - Victorian pubs had a sequence of separate private bars serve from a single bar - counter ,  in total contrast to the current fashion for single - room pubs .  The modern desire for open -	plan	has led to the removal of many bar - partitions , destroying the character of original interiors and distorting any attempt to create a truly Victorian interior . The small private bars not only created intimate areas within a pub for small groups of people ,  but also enabled a wide variety of people to be served in the same building .  A 1907 description of a typical suburban pub with six bars featured omnibus drivers and conductors in the four - ale bar ,  horny handed sons of toil and lady customers in the bar opposite ,  with other woman in the bottle and jug .	None
3003	plan	1	The Thirties Society has tried to counteract the brewers '  failure to understand the potential assets represented by their 20th century buildings ,  but since so few pubs are listed many cases escape our notice .  The County Arms at Blaby was subject to a proposal for theming as a Beefeater steakhouse some years ago ,  which was rejected by the local authority with support from the Thirties Society although the building is not listed .  More recently , the Prospect Inn was threatened by an enlargement scheme by Whitbread which would have totally destroyed the remaining original features of the building , and its remarkable	plan	. Fortunately ,  the Thirties Society was able to get the Prospect listed in May 1990 ,  and alternative development plans are awaited .  The Prospect Inn ,  which could be restored a major tourist attraction ,  is also threatened by a road widening proposal by Kent County Council ,  although the local authority ,  Thanet ,  understand its importance and value the building .

Road widening is an inevitable and current threat to many former roadhouses ,  such as the former Chez Laurie on the A299 near Herne Bay  ( W M Bishop ,  1936 )  .	None
3005	plan	1	The John Bull in Layerthorpe ,  York  ( B Wilson ,  1937 )  was a Tudor - style pub remarkable solely through having survived unaltered ,  but not listable simply on these grounds .  The needs of pub management in the 1980s have been hard to contain in pubs originally segregated into saloon and public bars ,  if not into further distinct spaces .   This has been the experience of the Thirties Society in fighting for the retention of the main	plan	features of the Nag 's Head , one of the few listed pubs of the period . Designed as a demonstration of bi - partite segregation between public and saloon ,  it lends itself poorly to unification ,  and the restorable public bar would have been lost in the process .  The Thirties Society negotiated a compromise scheme with the architects acting for Ind Coope which the owners found  unnacceptable  ,  threatening closure of the pub .	None
3006	plan	1	A more straightforward case is that concerning Jack Straw 's  Castle ,  which was listed after a scheme was submitted to cover the courtyard with a new restaurant .  The new emphasis was to be on dining rather than drinking ,  and the design was as sensitive as it could have been .  Due to the circumstances of the original build , there are some strange anomalies in the	plan	, but the courtyard remains a key part of the design , much enjoyed by visitors in the summer , sitting under a fine specimen walnut tree . The scheme was taken to Public Inquiry in October 1990 ,  in which the Borough of Camden was supported by the Thirties Society and Lucy Archer ,  Raymond Erith 's  daughter and biographer .  The appeal was dismissed .	None
3007	plan	2	Good idea :  this would extend the tourist season into late summer and autumn and bring Britain more into line with its European neighbours .  The British Tourist Authority likes it .  The Government , however , has no immediate	plans	to change the public holiday set - up. The industry has marketed Britain energetically as a year - round destination ,  with many attractions that do not leave the visitor at the mercy of our fickle weather .  The public holidays should reflect that .	None

My	plan	for how I was going to live out the rest of my days had just been torn up in front of my face and I needed time to adjust . A little luck would not have come amiss ,  either .  The house was sold very quickly and the new owner immediately gave us all notice to quit .	None
3010	plan	2	They had become my friends and there was no way that I would now go back to being their problem dependant .  I wandered back north towards the church .  My	plan	was to sit around and wait for one of the parish team to appear and then to ask them for their advice . Accordingly ,  when I arrived there ,  I settled down in a pew at the back and nodded off .  After a while ,  I was woken by the noise of preparations  something happening .	None
3011	plan	2	It would probably be best if I started from square one ,  the contact opened the proceedings by saying .

It 's only just been finished but the	plan	is to have four people living there three clients or whatever and one person sponsored by us , probably a member of staff . Everyone has their own room with a little fridge and a kettle ,  but you do have to share kitchen and bathroom .  What role does your member of staff have in all this 	None
3012	plan	1	The calcareous clays ,  such as East Anglian boulder clay ,  are alkaline and therefore will not suit azaleas or rhododendrons .  But the acid or neutral clays which are found in many parts of Britain are as good for lime haters are are acid sands .  Planting	plans	Designing a beautiful garden is no more difficult on clay than anywhere else .

3013	plan	3	Once planted ,  and whether 10 or 50ft high ,  a tree becomes a focal point around which to build a complete plant community .

Contrived planting	plan	This process ,  which can take several decades in open country ,  may be contrived in only a few years in a garden by reversing the natural scheme of things .

3014	plan	3	By blanketing the soil they also help to control weeds .  Leguminous green manures ,  such as clover and beans ,  fix atmospheric nitrogen in the soil by means of their root nodules ,  so making it available to plants later in the growing season .  Including the planting of a green manure into a garden	plan	can seem difficult . The easiest way to start is to sow small patches when clearing crops in autumn .  Of course ,  if for any reason you have to leave your garden for several months ,  the best thing you can do is to sow a suitable green manure .	None

3016	plan	2	Such incidents can only be avoided if the pilot has a more open mind about where he is going to land .  For example ,  if the glider is too low to land conventionally in the normal landing area directly into the wind ,  it may well be possible to land across wind and behind the normal launching point ,  so that the low turn can be completed safely .  All too often the pilot has a	plan	is no longer feasible . It is sometimes quite hard for a person to do the unconventional ,  but that may be the only safe option .  However ,  if the pilot is thinking ahead ,  that option could have already been considered and he could have had the plan ready for use if more height was lost .	None
3017	plan	2	It is in these situations that centring skills are most useful .  When giving instruction in thermal soaring ,  I try to insist that students go on attempting to find lift until about 5600 feet ,  and I very often explain my own thoughts and precautions as they do the flying .  All the time during each turn it is essential to have a	plan	for the worst contingency and to know exactly what you would do if you suddenly lost 200 feet . In this way it is possible to use the lift low down with safety ,  provided that the thermals are not too turbulent .  Then it is necessary to give up much higher .	None

3025	plan	1	HO Circular  ( 194/78 )  describing British and American research literature on policing is another typically apologetic ,  anti - intellectual document ,  for within its first few paragraphs it admits :  the implication of attempting to establish a central research information centre to give advice to chief officers about research findings ,  or collect ,  collate and distribute research of interest to the police service ,  and maintain an up - to - date index of research would be very considerable .  There are no	plans	to establish such a centre . No one seems to have asked whether the Staff College could have taken on this job ,  but then again such anti - intellectualism is apparent even in the Bramshill Scholars '  Association .  In 1985 ,  they proposed to extend their role beyond that of an annual dining club for officers who had taken a degree through the police college scheme .	None
3026	plan	2	He talks enthusiastically about getting back to some real police work in the real world ,  even though his responsibilities as Divisional Commander will be mainly administrative and give him little or no contact with the dangerous classes .

Within 3 days of his successor 's arrival , we have a Dept. meeting where our new Chief Superintendent outlines his	plans	. In a run down on the style of deference he anticipates  ( which I note will stifle any critical point from below decks )  ,  he talks about his length of tenure and how long it will be before he can escape back into the real world .

Jay found Lucy 's  eyes on her sometimes when she looked up ,  but there was little enough time to meet .

If Her dreams were so vivid while the poem shimmered on her desk  signed ,  sealed ,  undelivered  that she had to catch herself from grabbing Lucy 's  hands ,  kissing her right out in the street ,  holding her close at the end of each day ,  saying ,  come home ,  darling ;  grabbing her and flinging her to the floor ,  ripping her clothes off ,  sinking into her breasts ,  fucking her like a sheet of flame .

They saw the sense of the	plan	and agreed to find refuges for the boys in the thick forest between Bolfracks and Kenmore .

( There had been no	plan	to illustrate the book , but Leonard talked his friend and fellow - student Freda Guttman into it , and so the book appeared with five designs from her hand ) . Professor Dudek had envisaged the series coming out in paper covers  ( the format that was just becoming the  way  to the mass market )  ;  Leonard ensured that it went into hard ;  Dudek had not meant the books to be prestigious in format but vehicles of introduction ;  Leonard saw to it that his book could stand alongside the best that there were from both sides of the Atlantic .

3036	plan	2	Associationism is long dead as a theory of thought ,  but externalism remains as a feature of most of its naturalistic successors ,  because ,  by virtue of their naturalism ,  they can find no space for intrinsic generality of mental contents .  The problem for the associationalist is exactly mirrored in those theories of thought and mind inspired by computers and artificial intelligence .  The human mind which , from this viewpoint , is the brain is said to work on the same	plan	as a computer , with operations being carried out on physical symbols . The question is ,  what gives these symbols meaning   The answer is that ,  as with associationism ,  their meaning comes from their relations to things external to themselves .	None
3037	plan	1	The Anniversary Organising Committee had felt that a clock should be commissioned to replace the one which had been stolen ,  and perhaps because I have for some years specialised in the reproduction of historic clocks ,  my name was one of those considered .  There were some practical considerations to be taken into account before the work could actually commence however .  Although several quite good photographs of the original clock existed these were in	plan	elevation only and there was no indication of the dimensions , particularly the depth . The photographs also indicated that the original had two trains  ( going and striking )  and indeed there were some interesting notes prepared by a Dr Byrom who was an enthusiastic amateur clock repairer ,  and who overhauled the clock in 1970 ,  but these were couched in very general terms .  At about the time the new clock was commissioned ,  I became seriously ill with a heart condition ,  and it proved not possible to undertake the extensive research required to faithfully replicate the old clock .

3047	plan	2	About 250,000 people live in residential homes ,  which are run by local authorities ,  charities or private companies .  These numbers have increased considerably over the past few years ,  partly because income support is available to help cover the fees of residential and nursing home care ,  and money to pay for care at home is not easily available .  At the time of writing , the Government 's	plans	are to change this system from April 1993 . Local authority social services departments will become responsible for assessing and arranging packages of care for people who need help .  Such people will ,  in most cases ,  be assessed for their ability to pay for services at home or in residential or nursing homes .	None
3048	plan	2	Tyneside has its Metro ,  Liverpool its underground lines ,  Strathclyde a lavish electric system .  Manchester at first lost out very badly on rail investment ,  but now it has some compensation in the Windsor Link and is  going ahead with an advanced tram system that will take over a number of heavy rail routes .  Birmingham and Sheffield are making similar	plans	. West Yorkshire ,  having presided over a massive expansion of rail traffic in recent years ,  is pushing for more electrification in the wake of the successful completion of InterCity 's  electrification to Leeds .  With the abolition of the metropolitan councils in 1986 ,  responsibility for the supervision of the PTEs has passed to joint boards of delegates from each of the metropolitan boroughs .	None
3049	plan	2	Had BR had more time and more funding ,  had the government been more sympathetic towards the railway investment and had there been no recession ,  the APT might have eventually been successful  but that is another story .  ( By 1988 the Italian Railways had produced a tilting train  the Pendolino  which  appears to be successful .  )  Not only was the non - fulfilment of the APT an enormous financial loss but since its rapid adoption in squadron service had been presumed there were no alternative	plans	for either trains or track . As the depression began to affect West Coast loadings it soon became clear that it was no longer possible to sustain the level of service provided in the 1974 Glasgow electric timetable .  The hourly off - peak service from Euston to Liverpool and Manchester was an early casualty when the service was cut back to a ninety - minute headway ,  but the most far - reaching change concerned the Anglo - Scottish services between Euston and Glasgow .	None
3050	plan	2	At one stage the average time of the five daytime trains between Euston and Glasgow was over five and a half hours .  However the long - term decline of the West Coast main line was not a prospect that InterCity was prepared to accept .  As a first stage towards reviving the route 's viability	plans	were made to accelerate certain key Glasgow services by raising the line speeds from 100 to 110mph ; the second stage was to prepare an investment case for new equipment to fill the gap which would otherwise have been covered by APT . Raising the maximum speed from 100 to 110mph was relatively easy .  While the fleet of Class 87 locomotives and Mk 3 stock was capable of 110mph ,  the only guards '  vans on the route were old Mk 1 cars restricted to 100mph .	None
3051	plan	2	To go with the new Class 90s an order was placed for twenty - nine Driving Van Trailers  ( DVTs )  to replace the old Mk 1 guards '  van .  By the close of the 1980s the West Coast had started to regain some of its old vitality and was emerging as the most utilised and profitable part of the  InterCity network .  Although no	plans	exist at present for 125mph train speeds , a more general extension of 110mph services is likely to start in 1990 . East Coast Main Line .  Probably because it started the 1980s with a fleet of new 125mph HSTs which had made a major impact on its market ,  the East Coast main line was far better placed to withstand the rigours of the recession than its West Coast neighbour .	None
3052	plan	2	As well as the series of long - distance trains which still run through Birmingham ,  the sub - sector now includes those few trains from the North West to Dover which run through Kensington Olympia in London ,  and the service between Manchester and Scotland via Preston and the West Coast main line .  In the late 1970s plans were prepared for a fleet of HSTs to operate the North East - South West  ( Newcastle/Leeds - Cardiff/Plymouth )  route and these were introduced from 1982 .  As already mentioned , many	plans	had to be changed in the light of the recession and these included reduction of the number of Cross Country HSTs . Plans to upgrade parts of Cross Country routes for higher speeds were also deferred .  However ,  although the Cross Country route has not emerged as a high - speed line per se ,  it now features a number of useful long - distance trains mainly aimed at the leisure market .	None
3053	plan	2	Further growth in leisure travel  ( which represents 29 per cent of NSE income )  was planned to follow the introduction of the Network Card on 29 September providing one - third discounts on off - peak travel .  Chris Green announced that NSE had a commitment to quality improvements on all fronts ,  but with full - blooded business direction aimed at maximising the high profile of the sector ,  to which his famous red lamp posts gave an immediate impact .  Longer term financial and quality improvements were to follow major station redevelopment schemes , including profitproducing office and retail elements , of which the redevelopment of Liverpool Street and for which new	plans	were announced in 1986 is a good example . The redevelopment of Liverpool Street involved the closure of the much decayed ex - North London Railway terminus at Broad Street ,  and the diversion from 30 June of the remaining North London Line services to the City via the newly constructed Graham Road curve into Liverpool Street using dual - voltage Class 313 units .  In retrospect the most important event of 1986 may have been the conception of the new Networker train ,  filling a vital gap price and quality wise ,  at long last making it possible for NSE to plan systematic replacement of old EMUs .	None
3054	plan	2	But 1988 ended with the disaster at Clapham discussed in the signalling chapter .  Given its success after only eighteen months ,  and the current plans to extend the Thameslink network ,  it now seems hard to believe that passengers have enjoyed the ability to cross London by regular electric BR services for  such a short time .  Success has been despite the somewhat confusing route	plan	initially imposed on the service south of the Thames by the necessity of incorporating the new service into an existing timetable without increasing mileage . Thameslink was formally inaugurated by HRH The Princess Royal on 25 April ,  when she combined its formal launch with that of Save the Children Week and travelled with a number of children on unit 319036 to Crystal Palace .  The everyday Thameslink service commenced on 16 May .	None

3056	plan	2	SUFFOLK brewers Tolly Cobbold celebrated the first anniversary of their rebirth by launching Ipswich Pride on draught at the town 's  beer festival .  The brewery was closed by Brent Walker in 1989 but a management team bought the site and restarted brewing a year later .  The team , led by Brian Cowie and Bob Wales , were able to buy the brewery from their employers , Brent Walker , after Ipswich council had slapped a planning order on the brewery site , stopping BW 's redevelopment	plans	. CAMRA were at the forefront of the fight to rescue the brewery .  A Tolly Cobbold Action Group collected more than 3,000 signatures against the closure and picketed Brent Walker 's  London offices .

3057	plan	2	By the time this column is read the curtain may have fallen on the empire created by George Walker ,  finally defeated by a 1.5bn debt burden .  The late appearance of Lonrho 's  Tony Rowland in the guide of Fairy Godmother  or is it the Wicked Witch    offering to wave the magic wand and change the bulk of the debt into convertible preference shares could have offered a reprieve .  But Rowland 's offer has been dismissed out of hand by Brent Walker and unless the bond holders , owed 102m in all , agree to the restructuring	plan	involving BW 's 47 bankers it would appear that the directors will have no other alternative but to put the company into receivership . If that happens Lonrho may be gambling on picking up the betting shop part of the operation for the proverbial song .

3062	plan	1	Apart from the different sizes available the packaging of ceramic wall tiles is confusing ,  to say the least .  Depending on the tile size and on the manufacturer concerned ,  you are likely to be offered packs containing anything from 6 to 50 tiles ,  and some packs  of 13 ,  22 and the like  do n't make estimating quantities any easier .  Fortunately , most retailers will split packs for you if buying whole packs would be uneconomical , so it 's best either to count up the numbers you need from a scale	plan	of the area to be tiled , or else to use the number per square metre figures given above . Tile designs alter with changing fashions in interior design ,  and current demand seems to be mainly for large areas of neutral or small - patterned tiles ,  perhaps interspersed with individual motif tiles on a matching background .  Plain tiles ,  often with a simple border frame ,  are also popular ,  as are tiles which create a frieze effect when laid alongside one another .	None

For instance ,  an architect may want an office floor plan with walls ,  furniture ,  plumbing ,  electrical wiring ,  and air conditioning all shown on different layers .  The	plan	can then be produced in different versions showing different aspects of the overall design . All such detail goes into the drawing description of file .  The result can be a very long document in a complicated coding scheme ,  but it forms a powerful description of design information without any compromise made in accuracy .	None
3076	plan	2	At the core of the problems in the development of the Taurus system is the rapidly changing character of financial markets and their structure .  When original objectives were set out in the early 1980s for improving services and reducing costs at the exchange through cutting down on the amount of paperwork ,  more detailed efforts were made to put the objectives into action .  These were overtaken by the Government 's	plans	to deregulate the British securities market , announced in 1983 , which were to lead to Big Bang . There were then more pressing priorities .  But since 1987 there has been added impetus to the development of the Taurus programme ,  triggered largely by the post - Big Bang boom in share dealing and the subsequent crash in 1987 .	None
3077	plan	2	BIIBA ,  as the trade association attempting to represent most middlemen ,  is equally unhappy that Fimbra is attempting to bring in a centralised insurance scheme ,  as most of BIIBA 's  members have their own professional indemnity insurance cover .  A centralised scheme would disrupt existing relationships between BIIBA members and their insurers ,  and lose them valuable financial advantages such as a no claims bonus .  BIIBA wanted a stay of execution on Fimbra 's	plans	and thought that it had gained such a deal when its chairman , David Palmer , met Fimbra chairman Lord Elton . In those discussions BIIBA claims that it was agreed that its members would be allowed to renew their existing policies up to 31 October 1990 .  A misunderstanding then seems to have occurred with Fimbra writing to its members last week saying that its scheme had not been altered in any way and that members could not renew existing policies if the renewal date was after 1990 .

3081	plan	2	Ferranti then hopes to decide on a course of action and in particular on how to restructure its capital base .  It has already undertaken to sell off 100m worth of businesses and to raise 150m through a rights issue or by attracting a suitor .  Sir Derek said last night that he had glanced at the Hill Samuel	plan	and was interested to see how it works out . But he stressed :  It 's  only an idea ,  not a proposal ,  and it needs a lot more work .  The Hill Samuel plan envisages splitting off the UK naval and avionics businesses and giving shareholders one share in the new company for every share they hold in the existing organisation .	None

Australian Mutual Provident executives were yesterday believed to be mounting	plans	for a takeover which could be one of the largest acquisitions made in the British life insurer sector . Any bid which has not been discussed with us will have to be considered ,  said Mr Holland ,  yesterday .  I have a long standing arrangement to meet Mr Anderson this week .	None

3085	plan	2	By PATRICIA WYNN DAVIES ,  Legal Correspondent BARRISTERS could retain much of their monopoly over advocacy in the higher courts under a subtle agenda for discussion spelled out by Lord Donaldson ,  the Master of the Rolls ,  as he opened the Bar 's  annual conference in London at the weekend .  Signalling the beginning of a lower - key campaign against the	plans	of the Lord Chancellor , Lord Mackay of Clashfern , to give increased rights of audience in the High and Crown court to solicitors , Lord Donaldson called on the Bar to put aside the trauma , the acrimony and the recriminations which followed Lord Mackay 's Green Papers and to abandon the hustings . Lord Donaldson said objectives due to be included in this autumn 's  Bill were total freedom of choice for the client ,  unless the interests of justice otherwise require .  When those concerned turn their attention to this problem ,  they may find they have to make a distinction between litigation in which there is a direct public interest in the result and that in which the public interest is limited to ensuring that an adequate system of justice is available .

3086	plan	2	A YEAR ago Sir Angus Fraser took over from Sir Robin Ibbs as the Prime Minister 's  efficiency adviser and part - time head of her efficiency unit .  It was a tough assignment for two reasons .  First , Sir Robin and his team had developed , and persuaded ministers to adopt , the most radical	plan	the so - called Next Steps for restructuring the Civil Service in nearly 150 years . No successor could hope for such an earth - moving tenure as that .  Secondly ,  Sir Angus was barely a year out of the Civil Service after a career which had taken him to the chairmanship of the Customs and Excise .	None

However ,  comprehensives in relatively affluent rural and suburban areas will become richer .  A survey by the National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers reveals that under the new financing formula nearly 60 per cent of secondary schools will be less well funded and about 40 per cent better resourced .

3088	plan	2	The Labour Party Conference :  Policy review throws a spanner in the Whitehall machinery By COLIN HUGHES ,  Political Correspondent AN INCOMING Labour government would turn large areas of Whitehall upside down but the party 's policy review barely considers the implications of its	plans	for restructuring government departments . Scattered through the policy review are proposals to :  Drastically alter the status and organisation of the Department of Trade and Industry ;  Create two departments  a Department of Consumer Affairs ,  and a Department for Legal Administration ;  Create a Department of Environmental Protection within the existing Department of the Environment ;  Set up a plethora of new commissions and executive agencies ;  Set up a Women 's  Ministry .  Those are only the most overt changes advocated in the review papers .	None
3089	plan	2	A new Minister of Environmental Protection would operate inside the DoE .  That could work  though it is easy to imagine conflicts of interest with the housing and planning functions of the department .  More problematic will be Labour 's	plan	for the Ministry of Agriculture , Fisheries and Food . The priority of MAFF must become food ,  not farming ,  the policy review says .  Its main concerns would become food and the people who consume it ,  not farming and those who produce it .	None
3090	plan	2	Britain is lagging behind .  No telecottages have been established ,  but there are several initiatives in the offing .  The most advanced is a	plan	for five in the north of Scotland which will be funded by the Highlands and Islands Development Board and British Telecom .

His	plans	in ruins , he is now reduced , Micawber - like , to hoping something will turn up before his players face the All Blacks in five short weeks . At Bridgend he looked in despair ,  and he almost admitted as much :  I hope we can pull it together but sometimes I have my doubts .

Having dispatched the pride of Romania ,  Steaua Bucharest ,  and the cream of Wales ,  Neath ,  Toulon are next on the Bath hit - list .  To succeed again they will have to improve their fitness and concentration , the only flaws in an otherwise faultless game -	plan	. Having raced into a 14 - point interval lead ,  thanks to two tries from Tony Swift ,  another from Richard Lee and a Jonathan Callard conversion ,  they nearly allowed themselves to be knocked out of their stride by Neath 's  bludgeoning approach .  Tries by Allan Bateman and Colin Laity brought the home team back into the hunt and set up a stirring finale to the heavyweight contest .	None

He will miss tomorrow 's  encounter with Cheshire .  It meant that Yorkshire , if not previously committed to open	plan	, had no choice than to adopt one . This suited Peter Buckton and Simon Tipping admirably ;  they made the best possible use of the loose ball ,  punching holes through the Durham defence so that ,  as the final quarter was reached ,  Yorkshire led 25 - 6 .  Powerless to halt the irresistible Simon Irving and Paul Johnson ,  Howe led a spirited fightback with a try ,  to which Dave Cooke  the best of the title holders '  backs  added another ,  but Johnson later confirmed Yorkshire 's  legitimate hopes of being northern group winners with a third score from the backs .

3094	plan	2	Technology :  Problem of dividing up radio frequencies By MARY FAGAN THE GOVERNMENT faces controversy over	plans	to sell off the spectrum of radio frequencies .

Evidently ,  the stock market believes that matters will not rest there and Pearl 's  share price raced up 87p to 639p .  AMP has made its play for Pearl as part of long - term expansion	plans	. The group has dominant market share down - under ,  taking about a third of Australia 's  life insurance business ,  and needs to look beyond its local market for opportunities .  The Australians produced an impressive array of statistics to explain why the Pearl was underperforming and how it was losing market share .	None
3096	plan	2	Mr Holland was due to meet AMP 's  chairman ,  David Anderson ,  today in a meeting which had been planned since June. Because of the takeover moves the meeting was cancelled .  We are better served as an independent company getting on with our own	plans	without the involvement of any Australian freebooters , said Mr Holland . In its takeover deal Australian Mutual Provident is offering 605p in cash for each share investors hold in the Pearl .  Instead of accepting the cash deal Pearl shareholders can sell their shares in return for AMP 's  loan notes .	None
3097	plan	2	AMP has had a business in the UK since 1908 .  In March this year it increased its presence in the UK with the acquisition of London Life ,  the British mutual insurer ,  which attracted a measure of opposition from the British group 's  policyholders .  AMP argues that its proposed acquisition of Pearl represents a significant step in its	plans	to become a major force in international life insurance markets . The Australian group said that Pearl 's  policyholders will benefit from the deal through its capacity to bring new products and marketing skills and expertise in administration ,  computing and product development .  If successful in acquiring the British group it intends to operate Pearl as a separate entity with its own sales force .	None
3098	plan	2	It is an accepted practice in dire situations such as this that the board is replaced or supplemented by a new board charged with the function of restoring the fortunes of the company and the confidence of customers ,  the letter says .  You may care to consider whether this is not a practice to be followed in the case of Ferranti .  The Ferranti family 's demands came to light as a result of an approach by representatives of Hill Samuel and Murray Johnstone , who are canvassing support among shareholders for a	plan	to make Ferranti hive off its core UK defence interests and merge them with the defence activities of Thorn EMI . Trustees of Ferranti family shareholdings in the company wrote back saying there was an urgent need to reinforce the board so that proposals and the inevitable approaches that the company would receive could be reviewed by a strengthened board .  The statements that have been made by the company have made no reference to board changes ,  the letter said .	None
3099	plan	2	By C J FOX FOR A gang conspiring to conquer Europe ,  the Nazis were capable of conduct weirdly out of character .  There they were in 1934 hatching	plans	for invading Russia but allowing one of their army chiefs a typical monocled , duel - scarred , square - headed general of the High Command to reveal the lot to an RAF veteran over lunch at a plush Berlin restaurant . The astonished Briton ,  who recounts the event in this new autobiography ,  also recalls how his Nazi host remarked to him after the general had finished spouting :  I 'm sure it 's  not necessary to ask you not to pass any information on to the Communists .  Even the most myopic Teuton must have been able to see that the politely inquisitive Englishman being entrusted with these confidences had to be an Intelligence man.	None
3100	plan	2	While companies with factories in China show few signs of pulling out in a hurry ,  some have lost enthusiasm for further expansion .  A survey conducted by the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce showed that 55 per cent of companies had postponed further investment decisions ,  while another 36 per cent were still debating what to do .  For example , Tomei Industrial ( Holdings ) , an electronics company with 95 per cent of its production in China , accelerated expansion	plans	in Malaysia and Thailand , and hopes to cut China - based output to about 50 per cent of total production . Another company ,  Gold Peak Industries  ( Holdings )  ,  which makes car audio equipment ,  is also trying to hedge future risks by setting up new factories elsewhere .  In both cases ,  the companies were worried less about producing the goods than selling them .	None
3101	plan	2	And ,  according to Mr Abbell ,  it is common for US attorneys to use their experience in government once they move to private practice .  Yet at the same time as he was representing members of the Cali cartel ,  Mr Abbell was on Capitol Hill lobbying for changes in the international treaty on extradition which would favour the defendants in such cases .  Last month , at the height of terrorist violence in Colombia , he also floated a compromise	plan	between the US and the cartel leaders , under which the drug lords would stand trial in the US , but return to Colombia to serve their sentences . State Department officials variously described that idea as surreal and wacky last week ,  rejecting out of hand any negotiations with the cartel .  The question that has to be put is ,  do we have a cartel lobbyist in Washington   said Jack Blum ,  a former chief investigator for the Senate Foreign Relations sub - committee on terrorism and drugs .

3105	plan	2	We want it abandoned .  In the vote on the NUM motion three factors helped to tip the balance in favour of the Labour leadership :  the NUM lacked the support it commanded last month at Blackpool from Nalgo ,  the local government officers '  union ,  since the latter is not affiliated to the party ;  the pro - nuclear EETPU ,  absent from Blackpool since its expulsion from the TUC ,  cast its votes in favour of the leadership 's  stance ;  and Ucatt ,  the construction union ,  previously in favour of the 15 - year deadline ,  has recently withdrawn its opposition to the policy review plan .

The tanker had earlier been involved in a collision in Spain ,  but the refinery manager ,  Reg Clay ,  said there was no underwater damage that could have contributed to the incident .  Refinery staff , who had earlier feared that more oil had been lost , launched contingency	plans	and the nearby Oil Spill Service Centre was placed on alert .

So far non - advertising revenue stands at 38 per cent of turnover and around 30 per cent of profits , though HTV does not have	plans	to make any large acquisitions , such as the purchase of CCA Galleries last year . CCA was in these figures for just three months and fine art contributed 849,000 of profits ,  up from 156,000 .

3114	plan	2	The real problem is that ,  unless resisted ,  the vigorous pressure for federalism by some leaders in Europe will become an assumed part of our involvement in the European Community .  We did not agree to this on accession in 1972 ,  nor again in 1975 in the Referendum ,  nor in the acceptance of the Single European Act in 1986 .  Mr Haselhurst claims that he is not aware of any preconceived	plan	but seems unaware that Michel Rocard , Prime Minister of France , describes himself as a complete federalist and of the recent advocacy by the five Christian Democrat leaders in Europe of a Single European Government and a Single European Parliament . That is what convinces me where they would like to take us .

Possibly ,  Haines 's  public unveiling should have been left for a while as he felt unable at this early stage to give firm views on major issues ,  such as racing 's  finances and Jockey Club justice .

Above all it is aimed at the country 's  railways ,  where disorganisation and disruption and not only in politically - inflamed Soviet Transcaucasia have caused dangerous shortfalls of coal and oil stocks at power stations ,  and of other raw materials at factories across the country .  The outcome was none the less a climbdown for the government , which was obliged to drop its original	plan	to outlaw strikes in all sectors of industry for 15 months , amid deep divisions among parliamentarians over the extent of the powers to be granted . Instead ,  the new provisions will operate only until passage of a draft law on strikes ,  which itself bans such industrial action where it would endanger lives and health .  This Bill ,  which sets out detailed mechanisms for settling disputes ,  could be passed early next week .	None
3124	plan	2	Building societies face the threat of a further slowdown in their mortgage sales as pressure intensifies for an increase in base rates ,  and therefore mortgage rates .  The Halifax estate agency losses for the six months to 31 July compare with break - even in 1988 .  The society remains committed to its 700 - strong chain , though it said	plans	to create some new offices had been mothballed . There might also be a very few closures ,  it said .  Overall the society produced a comparatively strong 6.4 per cent increase in pre - tax profits to 237.7m for the half year .	None
3125	plan	2	A Halifax spokesman stressed the 20m provision on loans to the Kentish development Burrell 's  Wharf was highly prudent and would not necessarily lead to a loss of the same magnitude .  Halifax was the lead lender on the project with total exposure of 26m .  There were no	plans	to make major cuts in the 1,145 - branch building society network , though there could be the odd closure . The Leeds said the plan to close 60 of its 481 branches across the country was part of its long - term strategy and had not been forced on it by the housing recession .  The closures are mainly smaller ,  less profitable branches or those with overlapping parishes :  150 full - time and 93 part - time staff will lose their jobs ,  some of them through voluntary redundancy and early retirement .

Leicestershire is widely regarded as a pioneer of progressive primary methods .  The saga began last year when the council opened a new open -	plan	primary school to relieve overcrowding in Groby 's two existing primary schools .

3129	plan	2	From PETER PRINGLE in Washington UNDER intense pressure from congressional Democrats to increase aid to Poland and Hungary ,  the White House announced yesterday that President Bush will ask Congress for an additional 200m  ( 125m )  grant for Poland ,  almost doubling his previous request .  The White House spokesman , Marlin Fitzwater , said the aid would be contingent on completion of an economic stabilisation	plan	between Warsaw and the International Monetary Fund . Mr Fitzwater added that Mr Bush has invited both the Polish President ,  Wojciech Jaruzelski ,  and Prime Minister ,  Tadeusz Mazowiescki ,  to meet him in Washington .  The decision to increase American aid reflected the dramatic changes in Poland over the past two months ,  said Mr Fitzwater .	None

3134	plan	2	The Washington Times reported yesterday that senior US military officers in Panama gave the rebel officers tacit assurances of American assistance .  This was firmly denied by the Bush administration .  US officials admit that they knew about the coup	plans	as early as last Saturday , but say they were given little time to judge its chances of success or to plan any US involvement . Mr Baker 's  comments yesterday implied that the US government would be prepared to use its troops to back a Panamanian coup ,  but not this coup .

3140	plan	2	The situation was further confused because the rebels were led by Major Giroldi ,  whose battalion is charged with guarding the barracks and who presumably should have known whether the general was inside .  Many of the coup participants surrendered to General Noriega personally ,  and more than 200 soldiers who backed the uprising were arrested after nearly five hours of fighting .  General Noriega went on television to say he had been aware of the rebels '	plans	for about three weeks . His hand - picked President ,  Francisco Rodriguez ,  said the government had all kinds of proof that Washington was behind the coup attempt .  He said US soldiers had sealed off roads leading to the Panama Canal before the coup attempt ,  and that US aircraft had circled the combat areas .	None

The	plan	to make unions responsible for unofficial action arose out of the strikes in the summer on the London Underground , where an informal group of drivers and guards led a long series of stoppages over pay .

The United machinists complain the scheme leaves the airline with too much debt .  In testimony before a US congressional committee earlier this week , the machinists ' union said the takeover was based on a ludicrous business	plan	, and threatened an extended campaign to block the deal . KLM ,  meanwhile ,  is expected to maintain a reduced involvement in Northwest ,  keeping its foot in the door ,  one analyst suggested ,  until US policy of foreign ownership becomes more clear .  Mr Checchi ,  for his part ,  said yesterday that he does not intend to seek a new partner to replace the 225m shortfall ,  but will instead repay KLM out of operating profits  - a move analysts said would further endebt the airline .

Ackroyd warns us not to jump to a conflation here ,  but he is intrigued by the coincidence ,  and it might almost serve as an emblem of his concern throughout the biography with the connection between poetry and feigning ,  and with the potency of parody .  The biography suggests that Eliot was never to lose the divided sense of his youth that human life is futile and meaningless that man is a finite piece of reasonable misery , in the words of William Drummond of Hawthornden , a good poet who was also a great plagiarist , and a great seeker of	shelter	in books but that an eternal order might be felt for , or invented .

The machine could either stand on the threshing floor of an orthodox flail - threshing barn , which provided	shelter	from the weather , or it could be taken to the ricks in the fields . The first practice probably encouraged the retention of many old and large flail - threshing barns which might otherwise have fallen into disuse ,  inviting demolition .

In fact ,  it is desirable that they should meet and get to know each other for a day or two over a safe fence  ( possibly a mesh that a horse ca n't kick a leg through )  before they are put in with each other.

3226	shelter	0	In a small group there is less stress to the horses ,  especially those lower in the hierarchy ,  and it is also safer and more pleasant for the people handling and feeding them .  Obviously stallions and colts over ten months old need special arrangements ,  and brood mares and foals should have a paddock of their own ;  but sometimes other horses can be very aggressive .  Occasionally a gelding , or even a mare , may be so aggressive that there is a real possibility of it seriously injuring another horse , especially if there are	shelter	sheds another horse can be trapped in , although for some horses even the corner of the paddock is enough . As we have already mentioned ,  for this reason ,  shelter sheds and troughs are never placed in the very corners of paddocks or yards .  It is normal not only for stallions to seek mares ,  but for a mare when she comes into season to seek a stallion .	None

3228	shelter	1	However ,  the horse in captivity usually cannot help itself in anxiety provoking situations :  it is dependent upon people for its reduction in anxiety ;  it relies upon people for its needs .  If the need is not satisfied it can have the most injurious results .  The need for food , water , and	shelter	is clear , but the horse 's other needs are less obvious . Horses need to be able to see different things happening around them ,  hear different sounds ,  and smell different smells ,  and so on :  they need variety and stimulation .  Lack of mental or sensory stimulation ,  in reality enforced boredom ,  is frequently imposed upon Thoroughbred race - horses ,  showhorses ,  and stallions ,  with devastating results .	None
3229	shelter	1	Distressed by the cold it eventually leaves its mother 's  side and finds the warmth and comfort of the dry stable .  Incredibly ,  it may not be until several hours later that mum follows her baby inside !  Probably these seemingly unintelligent mares were unable to find	shelter	in such weather when they were young , and now as older horses they put up with such conditions out of habit a habit that is not conducive to the best health of the horse . Horses learn new things easily when they are young ;  it is actually easier for them to learn new things than it is for older horses .  There are two reasons for this .	None
3230	shelter	0	Although they will gallop around trying to get rid of the bot - fly ,  they seem to quickly discover that the bot will not follow them into the dense shade of a shelter shed or stable .  Foals who have learnt to evade bot - flies in such a way ,  will continue to do so as adult horses if they have access to shelter. Older horses who do n't try and run away from bot - flies , usually have not had the use of	shelter	sheds when they were young , so have formed the habit of no longer attempting to evade these injurious insects . As we have seen ,  the establishment of a habit can create a situation where a horse refuses to think  irrespective of how intelligent a horse may be ,  and even if solving the problem is in the horse 's  own interests .  This became even more apparent to us when we tried to devise an intelligence test for horses .	None

There was correspondence with Woburn over the construction of a	shelter	for orange trees , to be added to an existing wall , with a moveable roof erected every autumn .

Back in Britain , men were called to arms ; everyone was issued with a gas mask ; sandbags were provided to protect specified buildings and to provide some	shelter	against the expected air attacks , and provision of Air Raid Shelters was hastened . Concern for the safety of young children resulted in a massive scheme to evacuate children from the vulnerable cities to safe homes in more isolated country areas .  Those endeavours were proved to be somewhat premature as no real bombing of cities occurred until the following year ,  and many of the  children had returned home only to have to be again evacuated when the bombing did start .

Seaweeds such as the brown kelp produce mucus - like materials to hold moisture , and in any case can survive desiccation ; and many animals , including shore crabs ,	shelter	among their damp fronds . So the shore - line creatures adopt several different strategies for survival ;  and animals from very different phyla  notably coelenterates ,  molluscs ,  crustaceans ,  and echinoderms  have found  ( various )  ways of coping with the intertidal zones .

3258	shelter	3	Mangroves are trees that grow right at the edge of the sea ,  held and nourished through characteristic prop roots that grip the soft mud .  They are not a specific kind of tree ,  but a way of being a tree ;  several unrelated species  ( black mangroves ,  white mangroves ,  etc )  are involved .

In particular ,  mangroves are the nurseries for huge numbers of tropical fish ,  which as adults live in the open sea .

Since the standard housing of towns and cities has been unable to provide	shelter	, urban populations have been compelled to take the situation into their own hands and put up their own homes . These squatter settlements have sprung up in great abundance ,  generally in undesirable and inaccessible areas ,  which are unsuitable for standard building .

Other governments have viewed the spontaneous housing settlements as wretched areas ,  which not only house society 's  drop - outs ,  but are also breeding grounds for crime and radical political activity The Brazilian government has tried to eradicate the squatter settlements for these reasons ,  which is especially the case in Rio de Janeiro ,  because of the added factor that it is an international tourist centre and the favelas  are so visible on the steep hillsides behind the luxury hotels and beaches .  Some of the favelas have been knocked down , but there still remains the problem of	shelter	for their inhabitants . As a result ,  when shacks disappear ,  others appear in other parts of the city .

From 1968 ,  the PLO sent raiding parties into Israel from southern Lebanon and the Israelis responded by launching their own revenge raids ,  often against Lebanese villages .  The motive was simple and comparatively cost - free : if the Lebanese villagers allowed armed Palestinians to take	shelter	among their homes , then they would be made to pay for it in blood . The only way to avoid Israeli attack was to eject the Palestinians from their villages .  This ,  of course ,  the Lebanese could not do .	None

Wordsworth also gives a description of a family spinning in the sunshine in The Brothers , but the Lake District has a higher than average rainfall and in wet and windy weather spinners no doubt sought	shelter	where it was available . There is considerable confusion about the use of the distaff ,  sometimes referred to as a Rock ,  probably because of the old terms Distaff and Spear sides of the family .  Writers often mistakenly use such terms as women spinning with their distaff .	None

3281	shelter	0	There were new sources of inspiration .  Where the palace ,  the temple ,  and the cathedral had inspired their Victorian predecessors ,  British station - builders of the inter - war years chose more democratic models  the cinema  ( Surbiton )  ,  the bank  ( Exmouth )  ,  and ,  with unintended irony ,  the garage  ( West Monkseaton )  .  They in their turn were to give way after tunenlightenedhe Second World War to the models of the bus -	shelter	, the airport , and the office - block , the ultimate in bankruptcy of imagination .

New large city stations were built at Toledo  ( 1950 )  and New Orleans  ( 1954 )  ,  but in a totally undistinguished style .  Otherwise bus	shelters	were provided when small stations were knocked or burned down. Just such a brave new station was the romantically named Route 128 at Boston .  By the time that the Educational Facilities Laboratories and the National Endowment for the Arts were producing their two excellent booklets on the reuse of railroad stations in 1974 and 1975 ,  only one per cent of all inter - city travel was by train .

This inaugurated a new wave of station - building .  At a time when new stations elsewhere meant bus	shelters	, fine new stations which retained at least some of the spirit of the old were provided at Taita , Palmerston North , and Rotorua , among others . Nevertheless ,  small rural stations have been closing throughout New Zealand ,  often to the accompaniment of vigorous opposition from New Zealand farmers .  Despite their rearguard action ,  however ,  freight handling has been concentrated at larger stations ,  destroying the role of the small station in the community .	None

3286	shelter	0	Look carefully at the pavement as there are many details that tell a story .  Coal hole covers were made in different patterns and embossed with the name of the foundry ;  outside older houses ,  the bootscrapers can often still be seen .  Many categories of street furniture can now be listed pillar boxes , telephone kiosks , drinking fountains and bus	shelters	. Though the traditional pillar boxes  oval ,  round or octagonal  appear at the moment safe ,  the wall - mounted variety are under threat .  Due to public outcry ,  well over 1,000  ( out of perhaps 50,000 )  red telephone boxes have been listed ,  but this of course is only a tiny fraction .	None
3287	shelter	0	A red telephone box on a village green is part of the country scene ,  as quintessential in its way as the village pond or pub .  A red telephone box in such circumstances may not be special in itself ,  but special to the area .  Great care was taken in the early years of this century to design bus	shelters	that were in keeping with country villages . They are not only worth preserving in themselves ;  a watchful eye needs to be kept to ensure that some other piece of street furniture  say one of the new all - glass telephone boxes  is not crudely juxtaposed beside them .  An active local society needs to be in constant contact with not only the local authority but all the public utilities .	None

3290	shelter	1	This change of emphasis from cash to produce is probably the most difficult mental hurdle .  Immediate cash profit has far too long been the overriding aim :  it has warped the genuine economy and forced farmers to consider every move in the context of How soon will it pay   Cash profits are necessary ; but the nearer a community can come to providing its own basic requirements of food ,	shelter	, and energy , the less cash is needed for the luxuries . Within the pattern of large - scale commercial farming ,  the independent smallholder can still provide more than his share of surplus food for the urban population ,  yet keep as top priority the conservation of his main capital  the soil .  The acceptance of discipline is probably the greatest step towards freedom a man can take ,  and nowhere is this so true as in smallholding .	None
3291	shelter	1	You should therefore devise a clear plan with priorities ,  and introduce your livestock bit by bit as your fencing permits .  By far the strongest and most permanent field divisions are stone walls .  Once built they will last forever , the materials for repairs are always on site , and they provide	shelter	from wind and weather . Few can afford the time and cost of building a new stone wall today ,  but the principles of dry stone walling ,  clearly outlined in Rainsford - Hannay 's  book Dry Stone Walling  ,  are straightforward and you can easily acquire enough skill to do effective repairs .  Well - laid hedges of thorn ,  hazel ,  holly ,  or beech  ( or more generally a mixture of several species )  form very effective barriers ,  and provide shelter for livestock and a habitat for wild life .

Hedge - laying is a highly skilled craft ,  and even at moderate charges your hedge will seem expensive .  But when you consider the ecological and aesthetic benefits as well as the	shelter	and livestock control , a good hedge is good value for money . But there are snags :  the buds and leaves of hazel and thorn are tasty when grass is scarce ,  particularly to inquisitive cattle .

3294	shelter	1	If this could be proved beyond doubt  ,  direct drilling would fit in well with the organic philosophy .  The drills are too expensive for a smallholding ,  and even in the hands of a contractor ,  the technique  ( including spraying )  is not cheaper than conventional tillage .  Perennial weeds such as couch or coltsfoot are more difficult to control , and slugs , which	shelter	and multiply in the deep , hard - sided slits , can become a serious pest . Winter cereals are slow to establish ,  and must be sown earlier :  this is apparently because there is a tendency for stubble or killed turf to be pushed down into the slits with the seed where it can create anaerobic conditions leading to the formation of toxic substances such as acetic acid .  But one might be forgiven for doubting if this is the most likely cause of the toxic side - effects of direct drilling !	None

So ,  one fine morning the magazine 's  publisher and feature writer received a notice informing them that Steven Morrissey and Johnny Marr were proceeding with an action for defamation of character .

Not only that , but one imagines such huts to be found in the very heart of the wilderness , where one cannot ascend a peak and walk out in a single day , and must take	shelter	for the night .

( A modern bungalow now occupies the site .  )  From this garden Coleridge could either walk on through Poole 's  orchard and a fine meadow to the home of his new friends ,  John and Anna Cruikshank ,  or he could negotiate Poole 's  tanyard and its Tartarean tan - pits to reach the Castle Street house itself .

3325	shelter	0	It was also in the closing weeks of the year that long explorations of the Somerset landscape by Coleridge and the Wordsworths began to have far reaching creative consequences .  During one excursion which probably occurred at this time Tom Poole took his friends to Walford 's  Gibbet on the Quantock slopes between Holford and Stowey ,  and there recounted John Walford 's  tragic history .  Walford , a charcoal - burner who had spent his solitary life in a woodland	shelter	built of poles and turf , was remembered by Tom Poole as a man remarkable for good temper and generosity , but one who also possessed ardent feelings and strong passions . He was deeply in love with an Over Stowey woman called Ann Rice ,  but was forced into marriage to a half - mad girl who had visited him at his shelter and who bore him two illegitimate children .  They married in June 1789 ,  and a month later ,  in despair and rage ,  he murdered her as they walked in the darkness to the Castle of Comfort Inn .	None
3326	shelter	0	Our connection for the prison camp did not leave until 11 o'clock and the Feldwebel was wondering what to do for the next two hours when the air raid siren blew .  It sounded the same as the English siren except that it was slower .  We went down into the station	shelter	and I experienced the familiar claustrophobic sensation of waiting for something to happen . The shelter was clean and well built .  Civilians sat on benches joking and playing cards and rocking screaming babies to sleep .	None
3327	shelter	3	But this was not so ;  no one landing there had ever been able to get out and the nearest airport was 600 miles away .  The pilots and crew had ,  in some instances ,  been able to trek overland to safety but the aircraft ,  valued at many millions ,  would remain there imprisoned forever .  Late that afternoon we made a perfect three - point landing at the RCAF airstrip in Whitehorse , capital of the Yukon Territory , where I found	shelter	for the night in a bare but adequate room at the Whitehorse Hotel . Not far away a turgid and fast moving river rushed southward in narrow gorges .  Beached there were old weather - worn skeletons of the side - wheeler paddle boats formerly used for passenger service between Whitehorse and Dawson City .	None
3328	shelter	1	Even before I got to understand guilt ,  I used to walk about the house muttering ,  You 're a subject for guilt ,  boy ,  a subject for guilt .  That is ,  of course ,  when I was n't actually casting an eye at the rope and pulley high over the hall or taking a glance at the shotgun .  I wrapped guilt around me like a thick overcoat , wallowed in it and even took	shelter	in it . In almost anything that happened I could find guilt and apply it to myself .  A ticking off at school ,  or a beating left me encrusted with guilt .	None
3329	shelter	1	Apart from the increased pressures on fuelwood ,  rubbish disposal is disfiguring the landscape ,  especially along the trail from Lukla ,  through Namche Bazar ,  to the Everest Base Camp .  Climbing expeditions into the peaks themselves have also left behind piles of rubbish ,  and Cullen  ( 1986 )  points out that the problem is compounded by the fact that in such a high Alpine environment decomposition rates are very slow so that discarded materials may persist for several years if not decades .  Moreover , expeditions tend to congregate in a few favoured areas which provide rapid access to peaks as well as adequate water supplies and	shelter	from natural hazards like avalanches . Add to this the rapid growth in the numbers of expeditions ,  climbers and trekkers which has occurred in recent years and it is not surprising that the problem has reached massive proportions despite the availability of new access sites from Tibet which was opened to climbers in 1980 .  Obviously ,  the harsh terrain and the inhospitable weather conditions mean that rubbish disposal is a subordinate concern ,  in relation to climbing goals and survival ,  of climbers in the mountain peaks ,  the major problem areas are the base camps .

This module has been developed using IBM 's  Graphics Kernel System and provides a number of display screens .  The most interesting are those which portray population flows as scaled ribbons on the network diagram , and evacuation	shelter	capacities as bar diagrams . The diagrams are updated periodically during the course of the simulation .  In dry parts of the world ,  such as Australia ,  forest and bush fires are an important natural hazard and some attention has been given to the ways in which GIS might help examine their potential impacts .

3331	shelter	1	As we neared Arran the clouds became denser ,  and in turn cast deep shadows over the Firth and the Arran coast ,  or were lit up with a glow of intensely bright sunlight ;  while the glory of Arran ,  its mountain - peaks ,  were lost amid the clouds that enshrouded them .  On landing I sought for the cottage occupied by the Duke of Hamilton 's  piper ,  in which some friends had found most comfortable quarters the season before .  I found it preoccupied by a little company of artists , either professional or amateur , who made use of the rainy day by camping in the coach - house to sketch from its	shelter	a fine group of trees , with some good foreground rock and bracken , all within a stone - throw of the cottage . The piper 's  little girl was mounted on horseback ,  and dispatched to Brodick in quest of a lodging ,  and returned with the news that there was a spare room at the Boat - house .  The Boat - house became my roosting - place while under the shadow of the mighty mountain of the wind ,  Goat Fell .	None
3332	shelter	3	None the less ,  Springhall is unwilling to conclude that young people were repressed by adults .  He asks rhetorically if there has been a deliberate conspiracy to keep adolescents in an inferior social and economic position .  In answering he correctly reminds us that young people are often of necessity in a subservient position as a result of their dependence on parents for food , clothing , and	shelter	; teachers for schooling ; employers for employment ; skilled workers for instruction in apprenticed trades ; and on youth workers for leisure activities . On this basis he maintains that these adults should not be seen as agents of social control repressing the young  as reductionist social history might suggest  but as agents of socialization preparing them for their future roles as citizens in a society to which most adolescents gave unthinking and willing allegiance .  No one disputes that agents of socialization were hard at work on working - class adolescents .	None

A snow - covered hedge loomed up ahead of him and he made for the	shelter	of it . As he reached it ,  the ground fell away from under him and he rolled down into a deep ditch .  There was water at the bottom covered by a thin skin of ice and he splashed into it face first .	None

3335	shelter	0	Before the war began ,  listening to reminiscences of those who had experienced the last war and sensing their dread ,  I imagined that once a war had started ,  no one would ever be happy again .  The reality surprised me at first ,  and then like everyone else ,  I took it for granted .  The rationing of food and of clothes , the air raid warnings which sent us into	shelters	, the trains which ran late and were always overcrowded , these things became an accepted part of life . Far from the atmosphere of doom and gloom which I had imagined ,  there was far more camaraderie and cheerfulness than is shown nowadays .  It is a sad reflection on life that it takes danger and suffering to bring people closer together .	None

Another undignified scramble , over the wall into the pheasantry and the	shelter	of the trees . Here the last of the French had regrouped to make a final stand before the inevitable retreat .  From trees and undergrowth they fired at the victors again and again ,  as they swarmed over the wall in twos and threes ,  then in dozens and scores ,  and finally in hundreds .	None

3340	sort	2	Conditions on most death rows are appalling .  In Alabama 's  West Jefferson Prison inmates are kept in tiny cells ,  with the bare minimum of furniture .  There is no outside view of any	sort	and the only time they leave the cell is for weekend visits from relatives , bi - daily showers or for 45 minutes ' daily exercise .

3341	sort	2	Our American friend 's  cousin in London is an art student .  Her college library has interesting books ,  as well as the latest art magazines .  Her course teacher has given her a reading list , and the library staff are good at helping students with all	sorts	of interests . As part of the course ,  she has to choose a subject of her own about which to write a paper ;  one of her difficulties is to know how to form her own views ,  not just copy already received opinions .  She is looking for critical views against which to pitch her own ;  it seems that she may have chosen the wrong sort of topic ,  since on a holiday in Italy she had been stunned by the newly renovated Michelangelo ceiling in the Sistine Chapel in Rome ,  and although there were plenty of books about it ,  many of them went into extravagant detail .	None
3342	sort	2	Things are not so simple ,  as some art historians write well about the present ,  with a generosity of feeling and approach enriching to contemporary culture .  They are capable of assessing modern art in its own terms ,  partly from experience gained through judging work of other periods within quite different terms .  Meyer Schapiro , who had a specialist concern with Romanesque art , was an open - minded historian of this	sort	. He wrote enthusiastically about the later work of Arshile Gorky :  Gorky 's  atmosphere ,  veiling the hard opaque wall of the canvas ,  evokes a nocturnal void or the vague ,  unstable image - space of the day - dreaming mind .  And he remembered the painter :	None
3343	sort	2	Indeed ,  there are some who feel that there should be no border ,  thinking back nostalgically to days when there was only one domain of art .  In some writing today ,  too ,  it is possible to find the words critic and historian being used interchangeably .  Art is after all the subject of attention for both critic and historian , even though the functions and methods of the two	sorts	of writer have drawn apart . Fifty years ago they were in closer touch .  It was in 1936 that the first American edition of Lionello Venturi 's  History of Art Criticism  was published ,  containing material which could equally have found a place in a book about art history .	None
3344	sort	2	A guide to art reference books published in 1969 had 2,500 entries ,  some of which referred to series ;  for example ,  there was a single entry for the series of monographs on individual artists ,  called Klassiker der Kunst  ,  also published in French as Classiques d'Art  ,  in which there are thirty - eight books .  This guide was extensively revised over nine  years ,  and was republished in 1980 as a Guide to the Literature of Art  History ,  intended for persons doing serious research in the field of art history .  Another	sort	of writing about art is what artists themselves have written , either about their own work or about other artists . This may be by way of theory ,  or on more matter - of - fact lines about technique or such questions as composition .  Some writing by artists takes the form of instruction ;  in every period manuals on how to do it ,  whether drawing ,  making sculpture or other technical tasks are found ,  though their incidence is irregular ,  and such treatises are often the work of minor artists ,  rather than the great ;  Leonardo is an exception .	None
3345	sort	2	Moreover ,  other cultures ,  such as those of Africa ,  have had to wait until even more recent times for recognition .  It is literature within the last three centuries ,  then ,  that provides the main choices for a reader .  The advice offered here is that a reader should ignore what category of writing a book or article may come under , since helpful art criticism may be found in all	sorts	of sources . There is no need to be intimidated by the formality of a staid institution 's  catalogue ,  or to neglect popular magazines ;  as for writing in various academic disciplines ,  there ought to be no barrier to learning about an interesting topic .  The reader 's  question of a book or an article should be what function the writing is able or unable to perform 	None
3346	sort	2	Academies of art ,  whether in the West or in the Orient ,  have had lists of priorities in themes of art ,  in which there are many similarities .  For example ,  in twelfth - century China ,  a catalogue of the Imperial collection had ten headings :  Taoist and Buddhist subjects ,  human affairs ,  palaces and other buildings ,  foreign tribes ,  dragons and fishes ,  landscapes ,  animals ,  flowers and birds ,  ink bamboos ,  and finally vegetables and fruit .  This	sort	of listing is worth knowing by a reader , who may occasionally notice that it underlies the degree of attention being paid to a theme by a critic . THE SURVEY WITH A THEORY The last type of survey to be considered has a basis in theory .	None
3347	sort	2	A first broad division between types of exhibitions needs to be made .  There are shows which could be grouped under the heading of historical exhibitions ;  there are mixed exhibitions and group exhibitions of works by living artists ;  and there are exhibitions in dealers '  galleries ,  notably solo shows .  The catalogues which accompany these events have rather different characters , for although there are entries for the exhibited works in each	sort	of catalogue , and usually an introduction , historical catalogues often have additional essays . Catalogues of major shows have also become bigger and more expensive in recent years ,  usually through the help of national ,  industrial or commercial sponsorship .  A characteristic historical exhibition may be called something like The Age of Rembrandt ,  or Shock of Recognition ;  the landscape of English Romanticism and the Dutch seventeenth - century school ;  both of these are actual titles .

3348	sort	2	It celebrates creativity amid doubt and despondency  creativity as energy but also as a duty ,  work to be done by man as it is the sun 's  task to shine .  I have pointed out to him that his picture echoes the medieval and Renaissance formula for St John on Patmos writing the Book of Revelation and for the evangelists writing the Gospels ,  itself derived from Greco - Roman author portraits .  This was not his intention but iconographical echoes of this	sort	do not surprise him. The writer goes on to make further points about the picture 's  elements .  These examples of catalogues containing helpful art criticism could be contrasted with many others which are limited to lists of exhibitions ,  details of the artist 's  career ,  and entries for the works displayed .	None
3349	sort	1	An example is the catalogue of paintings by Nol Coward ,  which was prefaced by a memoir of the playwright ,  describing his interest in painting .  In marketing a sale of rather little - known works ,  too ,  there may be some explanatory text .  It would be wrong to dismiss this	sort	of criticism as mere sales talk , particularly in grand auctioneers ' catalogues , though there is little danger of such publications being reticent . Part of the charm of a sale is that the financial result is in itself a sort of critical judgement ,  reflecting even if not defining the taste and mood of the moment .  But an auction is mainly a bullish market ;  vendors are trying to improve their prices ,  and few except dealers are selling on the market 's  way down ,  in order to rebuy .	None

Part of the charm of a sale is that the financial result is in itself a	sort	of critical judgement , reflecting even if not defining the taste and mood of the moment . But an auction is mainly a bullish market ;  vendors are trying to improve their prices ,  and few except dealers are selling on the market 's  way down ,  in order to rebuy .  This bearish tactic does not work as well as in a stock market ,  for art works are widely dispersed ,  and decisions to buy or sell may be thoroughly unpredictable .	None
3351	sort	2	Some of the work for a museum catalogue may have already been done before the acquisition of a picture .  It may ,  for example ,  have been part of a private collection which itself was catalogued ,  especially if the collector in question was rich .  In this respect , the scholarly standard of a private collection 's catalogue will be very high , and the	sort	of information which a reader can expect will be the same . The collection will not ,  however ,  be accessible as public collections are .  In an art museum works can be studied at leisure ,  and will receive attention from scholars and experts of many kinds .	None
3352	sort	2	The quotation is from an article of 1954 ,  at a time when Picasso 's  reputation was very high .  Heron was anxious to point out Braque 's  qualities ,  so he trailed his coat openly .   To suggest , as I do , that Georges Braque is the greatest living painter is to remind a contemporary audience , fed to satiety on brilliant innovation , frenzied novelty and every	sort	of spontaneous expression , that , after all , permanence , grandeur , deliberation , lucidity and calm are paramount virtues of the art of painting The rival genius of Picasso has proved to the world that our age may be epitomized by works which  ( show )  his unfailing sense of visual drama ,  his protean invention and his power of investing his creations with a hallucinatory poetry .  Heron shows in his article a deep sympathy with Braque 's  work ,  which ,  incidentally ,  was a sort of painting he himself was seeking to practise at the time .	None
3353	sort	2	Tom Taylor ,  mentor and leader ,  had died before the group had its first exhibition ,  but remains classed with his friends .  They subsequently developed individual styles and separate interests ,  as is true of most groups of artists ,  but their initial appearance was defined by a programme .  Another	sort	of title for a group is exemplified by Der Blaue Reiter ( The Blue Rider ) . Forty - three works by fourteen painters were shown in 1911 at the First Exhibition by the Editorial Board of The Blue Rider  ,  the publication concerned being an almanac which appeared in 1912 with a drawing of a horseman by Kandinsky on the cover .  The second exhibition included thirty - one artists .	None
3354	sort	2	MIXED EXHIBITIONS Mixed exhibitions are ideal for spotting talent ahead of the market ,  as well as being a significant source of income for many artists .  The most common	sort	of mixed exhibition is the exhibiting society , whose history is entwined with the development of art in Europe since the eighteenth century . The shows put on in Paris at the Salon ,  and in London at the Royal Academy ,  were a means of creating sales for artists at a turning point in the history of patronage ;  as there developed a middle - class market for literature ,  so there developed a comparable market for art .  Denis Diderot gained lasting fame as the energetic editor of the French Encyclopaedia  ,  but he is also rightly celebrated as an art critic .	None
3355	sort	2	A cynic will remember that research into the opinion - forming powers of newspapers has tended  to conclude that readers expect to have their existing views confirmed .  If so ,  the power of critics may be no more than the listings services offered in the papers or on posters ,  while real power can be found in the organisation of the art market .  A different	sort	of exhibition which has had some success in attracting attention , and thus newspaper coverage , is the prize competition . Here the critic is absolved from making judgements of his own by the need to report what a jury has decided about prizes .  The critic 's  standing is thereby reduced ,  and the description or evaluation of the prize works is less than likely to be uninfluenced by their new position .	None
3356	sort	2	The arguments put forward can be interesting in themselves ,  but their drift is often towards making the context of the art shown more understandable .  Art politics or cultural history are favourite themes for such reviewers ,  apart from the spectrum of cognate disciplines which may be the specialities of writers who are only occasionally concerned with art .  Thematic articles are likely to be found in two	sorts	of periodicals , general magazines and academic journals , either interdisciplinary or of specialist disciplines . Valuable interpretive ideas may be found in journals of psychology ,  aesthetics ,  philosophy ,  history ,  religion ,  sociology ,  anthropology ,  even medicine and biology ,  although these may not be matched up with descriptions and evaluations of art .  Such articles may not start with art ;  as Rudolf Arnheim said about his book ,  Art and Visual Perception  ,  he applied principles of visual perception to examples taken from the arts .	None
3357	sort	2	Articles of synthesis between art and other subjects may include important art criticism .  Literary theory is at present in demand as a point of reference for writing on the visual arts .  Articles on this	sort	of theme may appear in art periodicals , but are just as likely to be found in other journals , on literature , say , or history . What is most likely to be useful in such material is the chance that inferences can be drawn by the reader ,  seeing a similarity in a problem elsewhere with a question in the visual arts .   AS THINGS ARE :  DESCRIPTION	None
3358	sort	2	This usefully explores some of the resolvable questions ,  in particular those of crucial interest to students of landscape and the human figure .  One aspect of illusion is perspective ,  much valued in the Western tradition .  Three	sorts	of perspective are identified by Leonardo da Vinci in his treatise on painting , as follows : The first deals with the reasons of the  ( apparent )  diminution of objects as they recede from the eye ,  and is known as Perspective of Diminution :  the second contains the way colours vary as they recede from the eye :  the third and last explains how objects should appear less distinct in proportion as they are more remote .  And the names are as follows :  Linear perspective ,  the perspective of colour ,  the perspective of disappearance .	None
3359	sort	2	Paolo Uccello would have been the most delightful and imaginative genius since Giotto that had adorned the art of painting ,  if he had devoted as much pains to figures and animals as he did to questions of perspective ,  for ,  although these are ingenious and good in their way ,  yet an immoderate devotion to them causes an infinite waste of  time ,  fatigues nature ,  clogs the mind with difficulties ,  and frequently renders it sterile where it had previously been fertile and facile .  But when Uccello died in his eighties ,  He left a daughter who could design ,  and a wife who used to say that Paolo would remain the night long in his study to work out the lines of his perspective ,  and that when she called him to come to rest ,  he replied ,  Oh what a sweet thing this perspective is !  Mathematical perspective of a Renaissance	sort	had not been used in European medieval art , where the size of a figure often derives from the person 's importance , God the father never being small . A perspective may be used which reverses the convergence of lines in the distance ;  instead ,  lines of perspective converge in front of the viewer ,  an unexpected phenomenon for a twentieth - century spectator used to photographs .  Again ,  in Chinese art perspective is different from its treatment in the West .	None
3360	sort	1	A perspective may be used which reverses the convergence of lines in the distance ;  instead ,  lines of perspective converge in front of the viewer ,  an unexpected phenomenon for a twentieth - century spectator used to photographs .  Again ,  in Chinese art perspective is different from its treatment in the West .  There is one	sort	of Chinese perspective , seen as in the West from a level viewpoint , but this is only one of three treatments of space representation . It can be identified with p'ing yuan  ,  when one is able to see from the near parts to the furthest parts .  In this ,  as in Western perspective ,  the horizon line is somewhere below the middle of the picture .	None
3361	sort	2	Yet such a comment may need to be made ,  nevertheless ,  to point out the quality of a picture .  The critic who pays little notice to perspective or other means of representing the natural world will deprive a reader of help in enjoying the exceptional beauty of the natural appearance of Impressionist pictures ,  whose qualities are inspired by scientific understanding of light and its effects .  In a different	sort	of context , what appears to be an abstract design , devoid of reference to the natural world , may in fact be a stylisation of a person , an animal or an imagined figure . The totems of American Indians ,  the carvings of Inouk ,  ancient bronze ritual vessels from China ,  and many more examples can be found through the world and the centuries .  Most African sculpture is not in this category ,  as characteristically the masks and ritual objects of Africa are more evidently human or animal in appearance .	None
3362	sort	1	Are they able to look without too dominant a preconception coming from the Western tradition   There are amusing archaeological records in the nineteenth century of the inability of even trained artists to record what they saw ;  Assyrian figure sculptures ,  for example ,  were recorded as having unmistakably classical Greek features by an artist in the employ of the archaeologist Sir Henry Layard .  A different	sort	of description is an artist 's copy of a work . Copying was a well - paid occupation in nineteenth - century France ,  since private collectors and travellers were happy to have copies of pictures in famous collections like the Louvre .  Copying was also part of an artist 's  training ,  practised by Delacroix and Gricault ,  Czanne and Renoir .	None
3363	sort	2	At the age of sixty - eight Ingres made copies of masterpieces .  Accurate copies might be made ,  but there is in addition a category of interpretive copy ,  where the  artist copies those elements which most appeal to him. This	sort	of copy is at the same time description and interpretation , the salient points being brought out by the copyist , who gains greater understanding of a masterpiece by his work . It is not altogether satisfactory to call a print by an artist on the same theme as one of his paintings a description .  After all ,  it is an original work in itself .	None
3364	sort	1	It was a Romantic notion that there were resonances in the natural world and art ;  and it was Schiller who argued that music ,  the visual arts and poetry always become similar in their action on the mind .  THE AESTHETIC EXPERIENCE Describing the object is not the only	sort	of description that a reader can expect from a critic . The critic may be willing to share an experience with the reader ,  sometimes only of the circumstances in which a work was seen ,  as might be included in a personality article ;  but on other occasions the critic may give a fuller account of a personal response to a work of art .  This then becomes not a description of the object itself ,  but of the critical appreciation or dislike that the work gives rise to .	None
3365	sort	1	Michael J. Parsons describes his work in How We Understand Art  .  He can introduce us to some American girls and boys who spoke up about what they noticed and liked .  If Andy thought a drawing by Paul Klee looked	sort	of funny , he said so . Parsons has some  sensible reflections about how the children 's  comments can be connected with psychological theory .  Parsons outlines five stages of cognition ,  which he has based on the scientific work of Kohlberg .	None
3366	sort	2	This theory of stages in understanding art is helpful ,  and it will immediately be realised that the first two stages fit in with description ,  the next two with interpretation ,  while the final stage is judgement .  The theory is not so useful in defining the quality or strength of responses ,  and is no help in analysing the interactions of responses .  The theory is nevertheless of a	sort	which can be of real use in a classroom . Perhaps the most usual description of aesthetic experience in the last hundred years has occurred when the critic has been faced with the need to react to one isolated work of art .  It was Roger Fry 's  contention that an object ,  say a bunch of carrots on a market stall ,  could be viewed in a practical way as something to eat for supper ,  or aesthetically .	None
3367	sort	1	Unlike many of the towns through which he has bribed his way in his Peugeot  from the coast ,  this one is n't full of blood .  But it is between coups ,  or unrests ,  and has lately been smashed and looted .  It is the	sort	of place which will always revive and rebuild , and in such a place Salim 's part is to make good , carry on . The country ,  formerly a colony ,  now independent ,  is controlled by a black big man in the capital down - river .

3368	sort	1	At the same time ,  these hardships are a focus of his attention .  The two words carry a note of declamation  a note otherwise absent from Fraser 's  account .  Glasser 's prose is sometimes declamatory and sententious in an old - fashioned	sort	of way , and sometimes awkward ( Hidden in the near future , he was to be proved right ) . But it rises to many of its ferocious and grievous occasions .  We are in the Scotland of TB ,  pneumonia and drink ,  in which sex is spoken of as a matter of men attacking women .	None
3369	sort	1	Hawksmoor  speaks the words of romantic duality ,  and is in a number of ways a double book .  It consists of two alternating narratives ,  one of which is set in the eighteenth century and the other in the present ,  with the earlier delivered in the first person .  Each of the two principal actors glimpses his double in passing , as a reflection in a glass , and each stands to the other in the same relation a relation which presupposes , as in many other Gothic texts , some	sort	of metempsychosis or rebirth . Both of these men are disturbed or mad .  Nicholas Dyer is imagined as the builder of Nicholas Hawksmoor 's  churches in the East End of London ;  the enlightened edifices of a rational Christianity are thereby ascribed to a devil - worshipper ,  while the name Hawksmoor is assigned to the Detective Chief Superintendent who ,  in the later narrative ,  frets himself into a delirium over a series of stranglings which takes place in the vicinity of the churches .

3370	sort	1	In the second book ,  a photograph is spoken of which shows the pulling down of a monument to one of the Shahs  ( father or son )  in Teheran or some other Iranian city .  It is hard to be sure about the year the photograph was taken ,  since the monuments of both Pahlavis were pulled down several times ,  whenever the occasion presented itself to the people .  Here the confusions or uncertainties are the point of the passage : it does n't matter that the particulars of the caption are missing since this	sort	of thing was always happening . It matters less and less as we move into an enjoyable account derived from a vocational puller - down of statues of the Shah and his father .  The Shah was equal to these demolitions :  If we pulled one down ,  he set up three .	None
3371	sort	1	Guesses are hazarded ,  and are quoted from interviews he conducted .  A hint of child abuse may seem to be imparted by his account of a Gothic moment which came about during a walk with her father ,  at nightfall ,  in a setting of peasants and forests .  Ursula figures as some	sort	of Hungarian countess whose parents were estranged and who was to be estranged from her ominous father . There she once sat in some sort of castle ,  or not ,  reading ,  for sure ,  the literature of Romanticism ,  and growing up to resemble  in the opinion of the writer 's  aunt ,  the historian C. B. A. Behrens  a character out of Lermontov .  Lermontov ,  for his part ,  was a character out of Byron ,  and so was Pechorin ,  the hero of our time in Lermontov 's  novel of 1839 ,  one of those people who are fated to attract all kinds of unusual things .

3372	sort	1	The beauty of the earlier prose is ,  in part ,  a beauty of grace notes ,  the pointing of sentences ,  charged elegance and buoyant ,  intelligent wit .  In Take a girl like you  a great sentence falls like the dew from heaven during one of the scenes in Amis when a terminally drunk man endures a sexual turmoil and fiasco ,  is stunned by a stunning but not very nice girl .  This particular girl , a model , is putting Patrick in his place by going on about cars : Most of my friends have them on the firm , she said , with the	sort	of lift of the old proud head that he could hardly believe had not accompanied a limiting judgment on Villiers de l'Isle Adam . In Difficulties with girls  there are passages which recall that lift of the old proud head .  In silence ,  the two almost bowed almost stiffly to each other ,  behaving rather like two  well ,  two somethings - or - other ,  thought Patrick .	None

A third homosexual on the row 	None
3374	sort	2	The difference yields a political meaning ,  in other words ,  and it would also appear to relate to the old theory of the difference between an author who tells and an author who shows ,  and who employs a medley of voices in order to do so .  It is a distinction which may in the end prove more suggestive than serviceable :  the author who tells ,  and who can be accounted something of a ventriloquist ,  may well ,  for instance ,  be more than capable of carnival ,  and may even be every bit as plural in his works as his dialogic counterpart .  But it is possible to believe that the idea of ventriloquism which lies at the heart of it may be successfully applied both to some	sorts	of contemporary author and to some of what went before . The status of comedy is crucial to the debate ,  and we can at least be sure that Kingsley Amis would not object to having his practice compared with Waugh 's  ,  or to being placed with him among the monologists of the Right .  Against this monologic Amis can be set ,  by way of alter ego ,  the modernistic Amis of Barbara Everett 's  discussion of Difficulties with girls  ,  which occurred in the course of an essay on Hugh Kenner 's  fantasy of a British betrayal of Modernism ,  and which springs the surprise of conveying that Amis ,  so often supposed an enemy of Modernism ,  is really a Modernist .	None
3375	sort	1	But perhaps it is not too simple to suggest that we are also conscious of Zuckerman as a deflection of the wrath over Roth which works by making Zuckerman responsible for the outrage .  We are conscious of what Zuckerman does for Roth :  when he helps a man to gather his spilt heart pills ,  it is Roth helping himself by assigning a small mercy .  In The Facts , the tough guy with his shiksas , the supposedly self - hating Diaspora Jew , can be tenderised a word Roth likes , for all the awkwardness it imparts to the operations to which it refers into a	sort	of uxorious submission where his parents are concerned . This is a state which Zuckerman experiences and which he sends up. In the fictional conversation about adverse publicity a good mother meets a son anxious to reassure her ,  while alive to the comedy of it .	None
3376	sort	2	My very writing became a different adventure ,  no longer the dolorous itinerary of a convalescent ,  no longer a begging for compassion and friendly faces ,  but a lucid building ,  which now was no longer solitary ;  the work of a chemist who weighs and divides ,  measures and judges on the basis of assured proofs ,  and strives to answer questions .  These remarks concerning If this is a man  do not describe the kind of book which runs easily to sequels ,  and which is easy to live up to .  Nor do they describe the	sort	of thing we are supposed to like very much . The first two autobiographies ,  that is to say ,  are the kind of book to which a tradition of literary interpretation has been inimical ,  imagining for itself a literature of impersonality ,  in which autobiography is subsumed ,  invisible .  Philip Roth 's  article refers to this issue in referring to the later book If not now ,  when     Levi 's  Eastern ,  an adventure story of Jewish partisans during the closing months of the war ,  led by the Communist fighter - fiddler Gedaleh .

In the camps ,  work was imposed on the prisoners with the aim of exploiting and of destroying them .  It bore a hideous resemblance to the blighting , punishing	sorts	of work which are common in the world at large . And yet there was a work of survival to be attempted in the camps .  Intelligence ,  vigilance ,  practicality ,  cunning ,  luck ,  friendship  Levi was crucially helped by donations from an Italian workman he barely knew ,  and by the exercise of his skills as a chemist  kept you going and ,  in some few cases ,  made you free .

His classes are soliloquies and Socratic teases in which his interest in Classical Antiquity ,  in Pythagoras and Heraclitus ,  and in Hlderlin ,  Hegel and Marx ,  and in James Hogg ,  is imparted to the young ones .  He is the	sort	of Sixties dominie who used to inveigh in class against the system . His relationship with the kids is one between equals ,  but they also seem to expect him to be a wise  man ,  and this is what he sometimes expects of himself .  The kids are presented as decent and thoughtful ,  and there 's  an Arcadian absence of the stress and violence which some might look for in a class where the teacher swears and free - associates ,  and throws up and bunks off into the bargain .

3384	sort	2	The class structure of Northern Ireland is predictably dominated by protestants .  Of course ,  with the development of international monopoly capital and multinational companies ,  additional sources of power have been brought into play .  But it is likely that the professionals who have been responsible for the running of such companies at local level will have been allied to the more liberal group among the upper protestant classes , as represented by such families as the O'Neills , who have looked to the English public schools for the right	sort	of education . Wallis ,  Bruce ,  and Taylor  ( 1986 )  list this mainly landed gentry among the cosmopolitans of Ulster society .  Also cosmopolitan in outlook are a variety of traditional professions ,  particularly university lecturers .	None
3385	sort	2	But now ,  on the basis of a number of well - documented opinion polls ,  W. Harvey Cox  ( 1985 )  argues that the majority in the Republic of Ireland favouring reunification is barely two to one ,  and that in the island as a whole it is three to two .  What is more ,  Cox suggests that support in the South is at best lukewarm .  None the less , the characterization of catholic nationalist ideology I have just documented would seem to fly in the face of this	sort	of evidence . The general data presented by Cox are undeniable ,  but interpretation of the data rests on certain assumptions ,  principally that people act on an individualistic basis rather than as groups ,  and according to attitudes expressed in the quiet of their homes rather than in response to major events .  One remembers the substantial surge in Provisional support in the North on the occasion of the hunger strikes of 1981 ,  and the impact they had on Northern catholic  nationalist consciousness ,  one which Cox himself acknowledges .

Whenever possible ,  and especially if you are out of practice ,  choose a completely clear area on the landing ground and remember to prevent the glider weathercocking into wind at the end of the landing run .  Landing with obstructions on the upwind side is particularly dangerous and is just the	sort	of error people tend to make when they have n't flown for a while .

As it is ,  when I showed close colleagues my first working paper  ( Young 1979a )  on experiences in a police bridewell  ( see Chapters 2 and 3 )  ,  they were alarmed .  I was told on more than one occasion , that I should not really let outsiders see this	sort	of thing , even though it was agreed that what I had written was an accurate analysis of events . In some respects ,  I think it was the detail of the ethnographic thick description which most alarmed them ;  for as almost all of them wistfully pointed out :  it shows exactly how we do the business .  In effect the insider who questions the gross systems of classification which define police practice seems set to join those deviants or criminals who contest the system of law and order by breaking its rules and regulations .

3444	sort	2	Her own father ,  Solomon Klinitsky - Klein  ( sometimes Kline ,  who was born at Vilkaviki ;  the other side of the family come from Vilna )  ,  was hugely influential there ;  through his books ,  notably his Lexicon Of Hebrew Homonyms  which received excellent reviews in North America ,  Great Britain and Israel when published ,  became very well  known in his adopted land .  Another of his famous works was the Otsar Taamei Chazel  ,  or The Treasury Of Rabbinic Interpretations  ,  a thesaurus of views and definitions which was hailed as brilliant ,  indeed ,  unique in the sacred literature of his people .  Rabbi Klinitsky - Klein and his family had escaped to Canada through the good offices of a Jewish agency in 1923 the	sort	movingly described by Norman Glimotsky in his My Life , My Destiny . Up to that time their lives had been appallingly difficult ,  given the savage treatment their fellow - Poles meted out to them .  Insecurity ,  hunger ,  constant vilification and injustice were their lot ,  and it was as exhausted escapees that they made their way from Europe via Liverpool to Halifax  ( then the most important port on the Atlantic coast )  ,  before finally settling in Montreal .

3445	sort	1	With the disappearance of temple - worship as such ,  this fell into misuse ,  but a new significance took its place ,  which would have had particular significance for Leonard 's  parents and grandparents .  At this time the father dedicates his son to the study of the Torah or to the rabbinate .  There can be no doubt that something of this	sort	took place at this time in Montreal , and that it forms one of the subconscious inputs in the growing boy 's development , along with the high family traditions and the significance of his names . Moreover ,  the covenant with Israel signified by circumcision was offered to make of the nation A kingdom of priests and a holy nation .  ,  The whole people were theoretically a kingdom of priests by virtue of their privileged relationship with God .

It would be six years before that anger would begin to subside ,  six years of unspeakable anguish for those of Hebrew persuasion ,  when unbelievable monstrosities would be inflicted on them ,  by the end of which half of the world 's  Jewry had been murdered .  This was carefully shielded from the growing boy , though horror of a personal , more penetrating	sort	was to obtrude itself soon enough on him. The genteel and pleasant routine of life which he understood ,  despite the lengthening shadow of his father 's  illness ,  was convulsed in 1943 ,  when Nathan Cohen died ,  and the family was plunged into loss and grief .  Masha Cohen had always felt an outsider ,   vis -  - vis her more Westernised sisters - in - law.	None
3447	sort	2	Leonard could be fastidious to the nth degree in completing his own work  he has always said that he works one word at a time ,  and can spend months ,  even years ,  in adding finesse to it ;  he is nevertheless dismissive of anything approaching scholarly exactitude ,  still more so pedantry .  It is not clear where this comes from .  There is certainly an element which highly values the proprieties of artistic freedom : a work of art must be a work of free spirit , untrammelled by rules and regulations , wherein absolute consistency or conformity of any	sort	is out of place . But there also seems to be a more personal element ,  too .  In The  Favourite Game he turns on those who produce such work in a wholly negative way .	None
3448	sort	3	Leonard was fortunate in being welcomed  virtually as an equal  -  into the regular company of such as these older poets .  Not merely welcomed among them ,  but escorted around the country by them to various literary and poetry events ,  and often presented to their confrres as their protg .   It was during this time that he was invited to the discussions of the CIV/n group , a gathering of poets of the more serious	sort	and to some extent inspired by Ezra Pound 's revitalising energies , even as its name was culled from his writings who had just launched a new poetry magazine of that name . It included such as Wanda Staniszewska ,  Jackie Gallagher ,  Buddy Rozynski  ( cousin of Louis Dudek )  and Aileen Collins  ( later to be Mrs L. Dudek )  ,  Robert A. Currie ,  Yaffa Lerner ,  Anna Azzulo ,  Betty Sutherland  ( later Mrs Sutherland Layton )  ,  and Dudek himself .  Between April 1953 and March 1954 they produced the first five issues ,  meeting in Layton 's  home ,  occasionally at Rosengarten 's  ,  to discuss The Things That Matter  their latest poetry and material offered by others ,  not infrequently being led in song by Leonard on his ever - present guitar .

Twenty years later he could still recall the event :  I can think about my loyal dog buried in the snow ,   (  Death Of A Lady 's  Man  )  .  No one brought up in the Jewish faith with his	sort	of European connections could fail to be unaware , or convulsed , by the nightmare we call the Holocaust . Nightmares and night - time anxiety ,  are a regular feature of Leonard 's  work ,  though he did remark to us ,  I do n't think  that I was scarred by anything .  For someone whose life has been lived in search of the word ,  who perceived that a scar is what happens when the word is made flesh ,  who owned that his education began on hearing of the Holocaust ,  it is not a convincing comment .	None
3450	sort	2	The university authorities liked it ,  and readily consented to the use of its name .  Leonard was a natural choice for the first of the new series ,  both in bearing and background he represented ,  not merely McGill ,  but Canada itself ;  he was accordingly approached .  A manuscript of poems was assembled by him for the Professor to view ; the intention being ( and Dudek was very well experienced in this	sort	of work ) for him to take the matter over and see it through to publication . But Leonard bad different ideas .  He had seen beyond the excitement of being approached for his first book ;  he already visualised it on the bookshelves !	None
3451	sort	2	Apart from organising his domestic life ,  Stella Pullman was a disciplinarian in the old British landlady tradition  ( her husband was a former RAF pilot who now flew for BOAC )  .  She organised his professional life :  she demanded to know his daily quota of work  ( three pages a day )  and ensured he kept to it  on pain of leaving should he fail !  That	sort	of failure does not belong to Leonard Cohen , he is by nature an industrious and self - conscious worker , if restless ; and so he stayed . He got plenty of work done there ;  he made friends ;  he felt liberated and enjoyed himself .  He even found English girls desirable ,  a girl called Elizabeth in particular .	None
3452	sort	2	This pity ,  compassion or mercy ,  is quintessentially Jewish hasidic ;  to such God is essentially the God of Mercy and Compassion .  As against that central epithet of the rabbis ,  the justice of God ,  they posited the creative ,  life - giving and life - nurturing aspect of mercy  .  Sainthood and mercy are entities of the most considerable	sort	in Leonard Cohen 's work , as we shall see . Stephen Scobie ,  in emphasising the motif of sainthood in Leonard 's  writing ,  completely omits reference to this key Jewish emphasis ,  which would have prevented him from some of his more questionable comments ,  such as the reference to them as social outcasts .  Whether that is so in other societies ,  which is highly questionable ,  is irrelevant .	None

3459	sort	1	According to this account ,  the mind - body distinction as we know it was invented by Descartes .  He it was who conceived the idea of identifying mind with consciousness and of claiming that consciousness and its contents are radically different sods of things from bodies and their properties .  The mind is a	sort	of arena in which private objects are viewed : all our experience is , ultimately , confined to this arena . Descartes ,  so the story goes ,  reached this conception because ,  unlike his predecessors ,  the Aristotelians ,  he was obsessed by epistemological questions  that is ,  questions about what we can know and how we can know it .  He thought that the only things of which we could be really certain were things of which we were directly aware ,  that is ,  things in our own minds .	None
3460	sort	2	By contrast ,  the metaphysical question of what the preconditions are for the world 's  being accessible to thought was uppermost for Plato and Aristotle .  This is explained via the role of form  in the world .  The important thing about form , in either the Platonic or Aristotelian senses , is that forms are the	sort	of things that can be thought , or apprehended intellectually . There is ,  in common sense ,  something close to a paradox which generates the problem of universals .  This problem dominated philosophy from Plato until the seventeenth century .	None
3461	sort	1	This thought casts the world in a profoundly different light from common sense in its materialistic moment ;  and much of metaphysics can be seen as a response to it .  Aristotle was the first to try to naturalize the veins of generality that must structure any intelligible world ,  by saying that forms in things were individuals ,  not universals .  The controversy surrounding the interpretation of Aristotle 's conception of form is unending , but , on all interpretations , his objective is to give forms as great an affinity with particulars as is possible , consistent with their retaining a	sort	of generality which is , so to speak , released in the intellect when they are thought . Something that was not form ,  but was only matter ,  could not become general in this way and could not answer to the generality of  the concepts with which we think .  The naturalistic instinct has been to claim that mind somehow creates generality in a sense stronger than that which Aristotle allows ;  it does not merely release generality from its potential state in matter ,  but fabricates it .	None
3462	sort	2	The purport of that attack was to prove that generality could never be an intrinsic property of a mental content .  Berkeley 's  reason for thinking this was that he believed mental contents to be mental images ,  and there cannot be a general image .  It never seemed to occur to him that a general idea might be an entirely different	sort	of thing from an image . Ideas ,  according to Berkeley ,  are particulars whose significance is explained by saying that they stand for  the things they represent .  This naturally prompts the question what it is for one purely particular object to stand for  another .	None
3463	sort	2	But even if treating our awareness of our own mental states as topic - neutral plausibly explains why we are not aware of our brains as such when we are aware of our mental states ,  it does not explain why knowing fully about the brain does not include knowledge of the nature of experience .  Topic - neutral knowledge is weaker than ,  and hence is entailed by ,  full knowledge ,  though it does not entail it .  So , if the blind scientist BS knows that V is in brain state B and that B is the state usually brought about by experience of a red object , then he knows that V is in some state or other of the	sort	usually brought about by red objects . So ,  if he abstracts from his knowledge of what the brain state actually is ,  he can form the same conception of experience as that had by the subject of the experience .  In brief ,  topic neutrality was invoked to explain why ,  within the materialist scheme ,  consciousness of our mental states is not sufficient for knowledge of them as  brain states :  what it cannot do is explain why knowledge of brain states is not sufficient for knowledge of their nature as conscious states .	None
3464	sort	1	A rather similar ,  and equally mistaken ,  line of thought which might appeal is as follows .  It might be thought that the subject 's  apprehension of his own brain is more immediate  and more holistic  than any external knowledge ,  however complete ,  and that this explains the experiential difference between the two kinds of knowledge .  The scientist has essentially separate pieces of information , whereas the subject has a	sort	of Gestalt . Once again ,  this explanation shows a failure to grasp the radicalness of the physicalist perspective .  A Gestalt  is a mode of perception of a  group of objects  say of the dots in a printed picture  so that they are seen as one thing .	None
3465	sort	2	I now turn to a consideration of some implications of the cognitive neuropsychology of face recognition for phenomenology  an approach to the mind and mental phenomena that gives prominence to introspectible phenomena understood as acts of consciousness and their immediate objects .  Phenomenologists such as Dreyfus  ( 1972 )  argue that the level of explanation utilized in cognitive science does not truly exist .  The physical brain and the world of introspectible phenomenal experience are all that there really is : no cognitive psychologist has succeeded in defining another	sort	of input between these two which would provide the ultimate bits of information to which rules are applied ( p. 199 ) . My favourite phenomenological quote ,  however ,  comes from Jennings  ( 1986 )  :  social psychologists spent years conducting experiments to specify the exact parameters of a hypothetical motivational state called cognitive dissonance	None
3466	sort	2	These were eventually formalized in the Weber - Fechner law which reported a quantitative relationship between stimulus and subjective experience ,  the sensation increasing in proportion to the logarithm of the magnitude of the physical stimulus .  A quantitative correlation between the objective intensity of stimulus and the pattern of neural activity was subsequently demonstrated by physiologists recording from individual fibres .  Since the work of S. S. Stevens in the 1930s and later , it has been recognized that , although the Weber - Fechner Law holds for many	sorts	of sensory experience , the exponent varies widely ; nevertheless , the principle of a quantitative correlation between external stimulus , neural activity and experienced sensation remains intact and now appears to be well - established . So much for the basic laws .  The repeated confirmation of the correlation between the physical characteristics of the stimulus and the characteristics of the neural activity it triggers ,  and between the characteristics of the stimulus and that of the subjective sensation ,  has encouraged the belief that our sensations are in some sense to be understood in terms of a set of stimulation levels  ( spiking frequencies )  in the appropriate sensory pathways .

On a superficial level then ,  the SuperCut is the safer tool ,  slipping whenever problems arise ,  though there is concern about the chain breaking .

3486	sort	2	Breed :  Collie Problem :  Light bulb phobia Jess the collie was a laid - back	sort	of hound who spent most of his life stretched out on a fireside rug in his large Surrey home . The closest he came to exercise was to open one eye every so often ,  if someone entered the room ,  or to open both eyes ,  smile ,  and wag his tail as he 'd done on one occasion when confronted by a housebreaker !

Cocooned in false - Napoleonic narcissism  he reads about his own deed in the newspapers .  He goes in for a	sort	of hall - of - mirrors self - impersonation , telling people how he would have done the murder if he had done it ( which he has ) .

3490	sort	2	( iv )  The mere mention of the biting in Anna 's  manuscript record of At Tikhon 's  variants is enough to pull the reader back into The Possessed  ,  and he ca n't experience the sudden fierce tug of that novel without realizing simultaneously that the whole At Tikhon 's  chapter belongs elsewhere ,  to a different masterpiece .  Its footnote status in relation to Crime and Punishment constitutes , I admit , a funny	sort	of belonging , as does the obstructive force of Raskolnikov and Svidrigailov upon Dostoevsky 's attempt to give decisively new shape to the Great Sinner of his notebooks and letters and fondest creative hopes . A negative belonging ,  if you like .  But narrative tone is a different and affirmative matter .	None
3491	sort	2	The fury ,  the energy of The Possessed  seems quite magicaally unconvenanted .  The slippage principle should make for enervation and a general whittling away .  But on the contrary , this world of it was rumoured and that may well have been so followed at once by it is more likely that nothing of the	sort	happened again in the opening paragraphs is as exhilarating as the challenge of life 's opacities to a healthy curiosity . Indeed the overall triumph of art in this case is that the novel walks out into our fact rather than ourselves entering its fiction :  a very primitive and absolute form of consumer capitulation .  Dostoevsky has an impudent way of making his narrator declare As a chronicler I confine myself to presenting events exactly as they happened ,  and it 's  not my fault if they appear incredible  like the son of the house writing home about his time on the North - West Frontier of India .

3492	sort	1	This belongs to the last days of 1870 ,  more than a year after the murder in the park .  It signals the transformation of the large ,  lucid Great Sinner into the man who is beyond definition and self - definition ,  beyond calling himself bored ,  and whose actions  whether he is biting an ear or enduring a punch in the face or hanging by a well - soaped rope  explain  nothing and nobody .  A	sort	of paring - down : in my analysis a surrender of the crisis - and - clarity urge , and an unloading of all the consecutions of theory upon others , principally Kirillov and Shatov . And conversely ,  the same notebook entry celebrates the rounding - out of a comic conception miles away from the original ,  historic Granovsky ,  scarcely less free than Dostoevsky 's  ideal of art and lying too deep for tears .

His peculiar gloating obsequious humour , his	sort	of capricious self - satisfaction lurking in the very midst of plaintive protestations , are described and pondered .

But , as Peter immediately tells his father , this is just the	sort	of bon mot to expect from an idler who is being kept in the lap of luxury . Such taunts hurt .

3499	sort	2	I would n't advocate a university that would be cut off from society .  We know that we have to train people towards a profession .  I 'm against some	sorts	of professionalization , but it would be silly to think that the university should have nothing to do with any profession . You have to train people to become doctors or engineers or professors ,  and at the same time to train them in questioning all that  not only in a critical way ,  but I would say in a deconstructive way .  This is a double responsibility :  two responsibilities which sometimes are not compatible .	None
3500	sort	3	There are still many able academics who see their activity as  research in the traditional sense ,  by engaging in biographical ,  historical ,  or editorial work .  But where English departments are concerned research is more usually understood in the broader sense of adding conceptual rather than factual knowledge ,  which in practice means the proliferation of interpretation .  The brighter	sort	of aspiring academic is more commonly found marking up paperback copies of standard texts in different coloured inks than delving in libraries . Indeed ,  Terence Hawkes has defined and defended what he calls paperback research as a proper activity for those who lack the scholarly resources of the ancient universities .  The advent of poststructuralism has given a great impetus to interpretive productivity ,  since all the literary texts that were once interpreted to show organic unity and complexity of meaning can now be interpreted to reveal underlying clashes .	None
3501	sort	2	The experience of reading major works of literature can have an overpowering effect on the responsive reader  ( usually ,  but by no means invariably ,  the young reader )  .  Kafka wrote that a book should be an axe to shatter the frozen sea within us ;  Eliot said that we should properly find Othello  or Lear  frightful .  The right	sort	of literary experience can be like a nuclear explosion , whereas the human expressiveness that Scholes detects in the humblest graffito is more like the low - level radioactivity that is always present in the natural environment . There is ,  in fact ,  a good case for resisting the takeover of literature by culture ,  though it is not as strong as I once thought it was .  My doubts have grown during the years I have been thinking about and then writing this book ,  but for the moment I will concede that for many scholars and teachers a clarion - call to defend literature as literature would prove rousing and timely .

3502	sort	2	One of them ,  as the Left disapprovingly points out ,  is a mythologized version of past greatness which obfuscates the disagreeable realities of the present .  Certainly there are many bogus images of the national past around ,  culminating in the dream world peddled abroad by the British Tourist Board  ( though this is ,  alas ,  what Americans and others want to visit )  .  But people need myths of one	sort	or another , and the Left has its own , in memories of Wat Tyler , Cromwell , the Tolpuddle Martyrs , and the heroic industrial struggles of the past . Mythology ,  however partial ,  is better than blank amnesia .  This current feeling for the past might provide a way in adult classes of shifting the emphasis from popular modern writing to earlier literature .	None
3503	sort	3	It will certainly seem so to the Englishman  ( as I take him to be )  ,  who found in the Envoi to Hugh Selwyn  Mauberley   Pound 's  most explicit farewell to England ,  as he prepared to leave her in 1918  externality :  an externality which ,  considering what Mauberley  attempts ,  is utterly disabling .  This is the same reader who ,  having decided that the Envoi is  literary  ,  in a limiting sense ,  is provoked by the word magic in the middle stanza into deciding that the term literary becomes a good deal more limiting ,  for the term aesthetic rises to our lips ,  and so ,  perhaps ,  does American  ' And there we have it !  For this	sort	of Englishman , externality , to things English is what any American is condemned to ; and per contra inwardness with things English is what an Englishman quite simply has , painlessly , as a birthright . From this point of view ,  the only good American is one who stays shamefacedly mute about his English cousins ,  however many years he may have lived among them .  The same rule does not hold ,  it will be noticed ,  when there is any question of Englishmen talking about Americans .	None
3504	sort	1	And does n't this give us  faintly indeed ,  but unmistakably  just what we 've looked for in vain in all the other Sicilian allusions :  that 's  to say ,  evidence that when Pound was in Sicily he did n't go around with his eyes closed ,  his ears and nostrils stopped   For that surely is the disconcerting ,  downright depressing ,  reflection that this sorry catalogue must leave us with .  Sicily for Pound never but once had any existence that was n't either verbal ( as in the wordplay on Trinacria or the Eleanors ) , or else notional , ideological ( as providing a	sort	of slender mnemonic crutch for a tendentious reading of history ) . The contrast with Yeats is instructive ,  and it does n't work in Pound 's  favour .  The effect of the Sicilian experience on Yeats is disputed by Yeats scholars ,  but it is generally agreed that some effect there was .	None
3505	sort	3	True enough ,  but how easily this can lead to the conclusion that anyone who attempts to deal with things that matter must be a bore ,  that rather than run the risk of talking nonsense one should play it safe and stick to charming trifles .  This ,  remember ,  is W. H. Auden ,  whom for many years some people in England have regarded as himself too anxious not to bore ,  too anxious always to amuse .  If this suggests that there are other sorts of English people than the	sort	Auden has in his sights , on the other hand it lends point and force to his censure of Beerbohm , and of what Beerbohm stands for in English life . Auden goes on :   As it is ,  he slyly suggests that minor artists may look down their noses at major ones and that important work may be left to persons of an inferior kennel ,  like the Russians ,  the Germans ,  the Americans ,  who ,  poor dears ,  know no better .	None
3506	sort	2	We may even feel ,  as certainly  I do ,  that some of the later cantos are of such a nature that it 's  hard to conceive in any  age of a way of encountering them other than the way we 're here embarked upon .  And yet we need to remember  Pound ,  I think ,  would have wanted us to remember  what a latecome development this is in the relations between a poet and his readers ,  how recent this is ,  and ,  in the perspective of history ,  how bizarre .  We may surely placate the shade of Max Beerbohm sufficiently to acknowledge that the danger we run in approaching poetry this way is indeed the danger of one	sort	of professionalism specialized and therefore blinkered , inflexible , and humourless . I suspect that Pound is rueful at best when he looks down and sees us industriously annotating out of Sir Edward Coke Canto 107 ,  without noticing that the English language is in that canto handled with none of the sensitivity that would make those labours worthwhile .  What I am saying is that a lot of the common English objections to Ezra Pound have substance ,  and would be worth taking seriously ,  if only we could be sure that they were advanced in good faith ,  in humility ,  and with compassion .	None
3507	sort	3	Moreover Pound 's  anti - Semitism ,  later so notorious ,  certainly casts a sinister light on his readiness to broach these issues .  Yet these matters ,  it has been suggested ,  lie deep  indeed ,  unutterably  deep  in every American psyche ;  and it is good that from time to time the unutterable be uttered  it is ,  one might say ,  one of the things that we look to poets for .  There can be little doubt for instance that the doubtfulness or downright hostility felt towards Eliot by some Americans , particularly in recent decades , derives from the	sort	of American Eliot was and remained , long after he had taken British citizenship . Eliot hailed from St Louis ,  but the Eliots there seem to have regarded themselves as Bostonian and Unitarian missionaries to that mid - western Philistia .  The poet did not share this sense ,  he actively disliked it ,  but he could not escape  not even in Europe  from what he saw as the balefulness of that inheritance .	None
3508	sort	2	And if Pound so blithely overlooks that difference ,  does n't that mean that we have in him a critic who attends to form ,  to style ,  at the expense of what that form and that style are used so as to convey   Don't we have in him a formalist ,  in fact an aesthete   This is the brickbat that has been thrown at Pound from the first , and is thrown at him still , because of his unswerving attention to what makes poetry poetry , and not some other	sort	of discourse versified . It was the accusation ,  or the selfaccusation ,  that Pound wrestled with in Hugh Selwyn Mauberley  ,  and settled not wholly to his own or any one else 's  satisfaction .  In The Hard and Soft in French Poetry Pound confronts the issue very early ,  and deals with it to my mind conclusively .	None

3510	sort	2	The successful are always tempted to regard their success as a sort of blessing or reward for righteousness .  This can lead to judgements being made about the unsuccessful ,  the unemployed ,  the poor and the unintelligent which are both uncharitable and untrue .  I 'm thinking of the	sort	of attitude that suggests the unemployed do too little to help themselves , that if only you have determination and drive you can get on in the world . He says there are positive factors in the new atmosphere between local authorities and private enterprise ,  but it hardly touches on the problems of poor housing ,  lack of amenities and the continuing unemployment .  These problems are what lead to that sense of being left out ,  of isolation and despair ,  which in turn can lead to the symptoms we are familiar with  drug and alcohol abuse ,  crime and vandalism ,  debt and family break - up.

3512	sort	2	Nor is there any need to risk being challenged by alternative social visions ,  to attend to the views of every crackpot messiah round the world ,  since it matters very little what strange thoughts occur to people in Albania or Burkina Faso ,  for we are interested in what one could in some sense call the common ideological heritage of mankind .  Just so might the exhausted arrogance of a dying empire have expressed itself on the lips of a Roman senator waving away the news of a crackpot messiah among the Jews ,  and the strange thoughts that occur to people in Jerusalem or Galilee .  It does occur to Fukuyama that religion might have some	sort	of unease to express with all this , but he appears to conceive of religion under only two modes . On the one hand ,  there is fundamentalist counter - ideology ,  such as the Islamic theocratic state .

And on the other hand ,  there are less organised religious impulses ,  religion as individual preference .  This he knows can readily be accommodated as yet another	sort	of consumer commodity , within the sphere of personal life permitted in liberal societies . But there is no need to look to crackpot messiahs or fundamentalist theocracies to find a decisive religious rejection of Fukuyama 's  reading of human history .

Tiananmen demonstrated what most people in Hong Kong well knew ,  but preferred not to admit :  that the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party can and will do absolutely anything ,  however brutal and illegal ,  to further their grip on power .  The notion that they will be circumscribed by a Joint Declaration or a Basic Law ,  so confidently advanced in 1984 ,  now seems like a distant dream ;  1997 ,  by contrast ,  suddenly seems very real ,  and very close .

It was a medium of the grand form and of the surface ,  whether polychrome or monochrome ;  it was not a positive medium of the middle forms ,  like oak ,  or even usually of the assertive instrument ,  as bronze can be .  The grand form offered a scale of more or less assimilation to the form hidden in the wood , the surface a scale of textures , on both of which the sculptors played , and they are a	source	of specific qualities of the genre . A final chapter is devoted to four case studies :  Michael Erhart of Ulm ,  Tilmann Riemenschneider of Wurzburg ,  Veit Stoss of Nuremberg ,  and Hans Leinberger of Landshut .  These short studies are in part historical ,  but partly art criticism ;  the study of Leinberger is particularly relevant ,  as it comments both on an encounter with a sculpture and the problems of reading about it .

A final caution about using monographs about painters is that they can seldom be read alone .  Historical background is only compressed in a monograph ; biographical material may be more extensive in other	sources	; the painter 's contemporaries will not receive much attention , and may be slighted . Even illustrations may not be adequate ,  details of pictures often being poorly represented ,  leaving an artist 's  techniques ,  materials and handling to be discovered from more specialist studies .  The reader can hope ,  all the same ,  that the writer will give an account of the special merits of key pictures ,  and it is these art critical passages which can be of most help in enjoying or appreciating the chosen artist 's  achievement .

From the early 1940s ,  the Irish government began to work towards the introduction of a comprehensive health service for mothers and children in line with other legislative developments in Western countries .

3546	source	5	As has already been seen ,  it was the style of both church and politicians to avoid their mutual consultations being known ,  which tells us that the secularity of the state at that time was partially a faade ,  but one which it was felt by both interested parties had to be maintained ,  probably so as not to confuse the faithful .  In a letter to the Irish premier in 1947 ,  while an extensive health bill was going through parliament ,  the bishops pointed out that to claim such powers for the public authority ,  without qualification ,  is entirely and directly contrary to Catholic teaching on the rights of the family ,  the Church in education ,  the rights of the medical profession and voluntary institutions  (  Irish Independent  ,  12 Apr. 1951 ,  quoted Whyte 1980 :  143 )  .  It appeared that one of the main	sources	of the bishops ' opposition was the authoritarian nature of the legislation . That the bishops were  affected by the opposition of the medical profession to the scheme  clearly they stood to lose money and independence if such a scheme were implemented  seems likely .  Whereas similar provisions in other countries were mainly designed to provide facilities which could or could not be used ,  the Irish ones were to be compulsory and there was to be no choice of doctor .

The episode shows ,  as Whyte says ,  not a clash between Church and State but a shifting consensus involving them both ,   ( 1980 : 399 )  .

Douglas ( 1966 : 1973 ) has described how the boundaries which lie between the structures of holiness and the anti - structure of pollution are potential power bases and always the	source	of emotive reaction . Such relative positions were clearly set out for me in chains of metaphoric relevance ,  with real polises largely symbolized by the use of the body and its social and physical space .  Each link in the chain expressed a perceived correct place and tied this into an all - encompassing behavioural ideology which in turn determined our action .	None

Our structural reality is pre - selected on the basis of value and really to understand structured reality requires an understanding of the value	source	from which it is derived . One further consequence of attributing pre - eminence to quantity in relation to detection rates means that the prig who clears his slate  ( admits to lots of crimes ,  no matter how trivial )  becomes a prized catch ,  simply because he helps the figures .  His arrest ,  as I have suggested ,  will often be made by a uniform polis whose  physical handling of the body  ( the person apprehended )  will be tempered by an acute awareness of the need to maintain physical domination .

However ,  those of a more robust spirit will thrust directly into the opponent 's  attack ,  staking all on a combination block and counter .

3582	source	5	Sugar is positively detrimental to bodybuilding due to the fact that it causes a rise in insulin levels .  Intensive training routines cause the release of growth hormone from the pituitary gland ,  but insulin can block the release of this hormone and thereby nullify the effects of training .  The	source	of energy for a muscle contraction is Adenosine Triphosphate ( A.T.P . ) and this occurs in very small amounts in human muscle . Therefore ,  it needs to be rapidly regenerated if exercise is to continue ,  and this regeneration is brought about by a substance called Creatine Phosphate  ( C.P. )  .  The splitting of the A.T.P .  and C.P. molecules is the prime source of muscular energy .	None

Now ,  as a step away from the craftsman entrepreneur that has been John Makepeace 's  hallmark he has introduced a new course to Hooke Park College for manufacturing businesses that want to make better use of wood .

But no matter how we dispose of our goods ,  we are not in woodturning to make a living .  Hugh chides us for selling at what he regards as low prices , but he forgets that our hobby not our	source	of income ; it is a way of relaxing during evenings and weekends when the serious business of earning a living is over . We might even feel that any financial loss is a small price to pay for the satisfaction which woodturning brings .  This is where we differ from the professionals  they turn in order to earn ;  we earn in order to turn .	None
3588	source	6	Nevertheless ,  some flat pattern work can be fairly treated as marquetry ,  most often based on natural forms .  It can vary from single units to repeats and form borders to all - over effects .  Though it does not , in general , exemplify , the uniqueness of marquetry ( achieved by using the wood grain as the	source	of the visual effects ) it can be intriguing in spite of what I implied earlier about the limitations of the silhouette as a design form . Where problems do arise over cutting out narrow strips  which we have met before  it is sometimes best to cut in the background piecemeal ,  gluing in each subsection of background separately as you go along .  For the roundel pattern  ( fig. 2 )  ,  a cutting sequence is suggested .	None

3593	source	5	Not surprisingly ,  the Department of Transport ,  and in consequence the British Railways Board ,  maintained a policy of aiming to reduce the PSO so as to reduce the demands on the taxpayer .  Nationalised industries were first set annual cash limits under a Labour administration ,  but the concept was in line with Conservative Government policy to cut direct  taxation and release cash so that people  ( voters )  had a greater choice with what to do with their money .  John Welsby was appointed as the first Director , Provincial , and he set about evaluating the	sources	of the sector 's costs . Quite clearly ,  as costs were four times direct revenue ,  10 per cent  ( for example )  saving in costs had much more effect on the balance than did a potential 20 per cent increase in revenue ,  so energy was at first concentrated on the cost base .  A significant feature was the realisation that BR 's  policy to refurbish and life - extend the ageing fleet of diesel multiple units involved an enormous additional expense in the sudden requirement to extract all their blue and white asbestos .
